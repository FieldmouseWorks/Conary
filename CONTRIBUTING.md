## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Rust 1.98.0+** (edition 2024) -- install via [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
- **Git**
- **Linux** -- Conary uses Linux-specific APIs (namespaces, landlock, seccomp) and does not currently build on macOS or Windows

### Your First Contribution

Not sure where to start? Browse
[open issues](https://github.com/FieldmouseWorks/Conary/issues), especially
`good first issue` and `help wanted`. If the problem or desired outcome is
still unclear, open a thread in
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/FieldmouseWorks/Conary/discussions) and a
maintainer can help turn it into a real, bounded issue.

Small first contributions often include:
- Adding or improving unit tests (look for modules with low coverage)
- Fixing clippy warnings or improving error messages
- Documentation improvements in doc comments
- Small bug fixes in package parsers

Concrete first-wave validation tasks include:

- Extend `apps/conary/tests/live_host_mutation_safety.rs` with one more
  refusal-before-mutation case.
- Add a daily-driver CLI diagnostic assertion in
  `apps/conary/tests/cli_daily_ux.rs`.
- Clarify one checked behavior in `docs/SCRIPTLET_SECURITY.md` and verify it
  against `crates/conary-core/src/scriptlet/`.
- Improve the preview install path in `site/src/routes/install/+page.svelte`
  without adding unsupported claims.
- Add a narrow invariant to `scripts/check-doc-truth.sh` for a claim that has
  drifted before.
- Tighten one source-selection example in `docs/modules/source-selection.md`
  against `crates/conary-core/src/repository/effective_policy.rs`.

### Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Conary.git
cd Conary

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/FieldmouseWorks/Conary.git
```

### Using Coding Assistants

Conary explicitly welcomes contributors who work with an LLM or coding agent.
Use the tool that works for you; contributions are evaluated on the resulting
design, code, safety, tests, and review evidence, not on whether a human typed
every line. The repository is deliberately structured so a person and their
coding buddy can discover ownership and proof without private prompt lore.
Agent assistance does not weaken branch, review, security, or verification
requirements, and no proprietary assistant is required.

If you work with an LLM coding tool, read `AGENTS.md` and this contribution
workflow, then ask the repository router for the smallest relevant context:

```bash
bash scripts/agent-context.sh --list
bash scripts/agent-context.sh --feature <slug>
```

The selected packet points to its start-here files, owned paths, and focused
proof. Use `--brief` when only the route is needed.

Tool-specific files such as `CLAUDE.md`, `.agents/rules/conary.md`, and
`.github/copilot-instructions.md` are compatibility shims. Prefer the linked
canonical docs over copied instructions or stale local lore. Google agent work
uses Antigravity/`agy`.

## Building from Source

```bash
# Debug builds
cargo build -p conary
cargo build -p remi
cargo build -p conaryd

# Release build (optimized, slower to compile)
cargo build -p conary --release
```

For repeated builds, the repository-owned development environment shares
eligible compiler outputs across linked worktrees while leaving each
worktree's Cargo target isolated:

```bash
scripts/dev-build.sh cargo -- build -p conary
scripts/dev-build.sh cargo -- test -p remi
scripts/dev-build.sh iterate -- build -p conary
scripts/dev-build.sh status
```

The shared compiler cache lives under the common Git directory and is bounded
to 10 GiB by default. Existing `RUSTC_WRAPPER`, `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`,
`SCCACHE_DIR`, and `SCCACHE_CACHE_SIZE` values retain precedence. Use
`scripts/dev-build.sh clean --yes` only when intentionally clearing that
marked compiler cache; it never removes Cargo targets.

Use `iterate` for an optimized edit/build/run loop. It selects the repository's
no-LTO incremental `fast-release` profile and keeps the caller's isolated Cargo
target. That artifact is development-only: release, promotion, and final
performance evidence continue to use the exact `--release` profile.

The project root is a virtual Cargo workspace with eight members:
`apps/conary`, `apps/remi`, `apps/conaryd`, `apps/conary-test`,
`crates/conary-agent-contract`, `crates/conary-bootstrap`,
`crates/conary-core`, and `crates/conary-mcp`.
EROFS support uses `composefs-rs` directly in `crates/conary-core`.

## Running Tests

```bash
# CLI + core
cargo test -p conary
cargo test -p conary-core

# Service-owned code
cargo test -p remi
cargo test -p conaryd

# Test harness
cargo test -p conary-test

# Run a specific integration-test target owned by a package
cargo test -p conary --test database

# Library tests only
cargo test --lib

# Workspace doctests
cargo test --doc --workspace
```

Some `conary` and `conary-core` suites depend on host privileges, UID, umask,
namespaces, or tools and fail on ordinary developer hosts (tracked in #733).
Report those by exact test name against that issue and rely on CI's provisioned
workspace shards; do not retry or skip them silently.

All tests must pass before submitting a PR. At minimum, run the verification path that matches the code you touched:

1. `cargo fmt --check` -- formatting
2. `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings` -- workspace lint gate
3. `cargo test -p conary` -- CLI tests
4. `cargo test -p remi` -- when touching Remi/server/federation code
5. `cargo test -p conaryd` -- when touching daemon code

Run these locally before pushing to save CI round-trips:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test -p conary
```

If your change touches Remi, daemon code, federation, or service-owned shared types, also run:

```bash
cargo test -p remi
cargo test -p conaryd
```

## Code Style

### General Conventions

- **File headers**: Every Rust source file starts with its repo-relative path as a comment:
  ```rust
  // apps/conary/src/commands/example.rs
  ```
- **Database-first**: All runtime state lives in SQLite. No config files (INI, TOML, YAML, JSON) for runtime state.
- **CLI output**: Route user-facing status through `apps/conary/src/ui/` and
  use the guarded lowercase vocabulary such as `[ok]`, `[fail]`, and `[warn]`.
  Do not hand-roll status prefixes.
- **Clippy-clean**: All code must pass `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`. Pedantic lints are encouraged.
- **Unit-test placement**: Keep small tests in an inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests`.
  Once a Rust source file carries more than 300 inline unit-test lines, its unit
  tests belong in the sibling `<file>/tests.rs` behind `#[cfg(test)] mod tests;`.
  A new sibling extraction must reduce the parent, and its commit must state
  that reduction. Package-level integration tests remain under the package's
  top-level `tests/` directory.

### Rust Specifics

- Edition 2024, minimum supported Rust version 1.98.0
- Use `thiserror` for library/module error types
- Use `anyhow` for application-level error propagation
- Minimize `.unwrap()` in production code paths -- prefer `?` or explicit error handling
- Keep ownership explicit: service and daemon code live in `apps/remi` and `apps/conaryd`, not behind a root feature flag

### Maintainability Slices

Refactor and cleanup PRs are welcome when they make ownership clearer. Keep
them focused: name the current responsibility, the module or helper that should
own it, and the focused verification command that proves behavior is preserved
or intentionally changed.

`scripts/check-line-cap.sh` measures all lines outside syntax nodes whose combined
`cfg` predicates can hold with `test` enabled but cannot hold with it disabled
under any assignment of other cfg atoms. Items, fields, statements, and
expressions all participate. It ignores sibling and package-level test files, caps that
non-test portion at 1,000 lines, and caps the total inline test-only spans in
each file at 300 lines. Attributes whose final path segment is `test` also
mark inline tests, including those enabled by `cfg_attr` in a test build.
Every checked-in exception names the open issue that
owns its decomposition. The cited issue's state comes from the checked-in
`scripts/line-cap-issue-state.txt` snapshot, so refresh it with
`scripts/refresh-line-cap-issue-state.sh` whenever the allowlist changes; the
gate itself performs no network I/O. Add behavior to an over-cap file only
through the
ownership-based reorganization named by that issue. Thin registration,
dispatch, and re-export wiring may remain in the large hub only through an
issue-linked exception.

Large files are review signals. Use `scripts/line-count-report.sh` to refresh
the current hotspot list when planning broad maintenance work. Do not split a
file only to reduce line count; split when a responsibility has a clearer home.
Persisted state, package formats, trust metadata, and integration-test
manifests need explicit compatibility or migration decisions before they change.

Before a broad refactor or cleanup PR, run
`scripts/maintainability-drift-report.sh` for a warn-only view of changed-path
owner hints, focused proof commands, documentation-truth health, and current
Rust hotspots. Treat its output as review guidance, not as a substitute for
the feature card or the tests you actually ran.

### Feature Ownership And Verification

Use `docs/modules/feature-ownership.md` when a change is easier to describe as
a feature than as a crate or file. Each card names the files to read first, the
neighboring systems that can be affected, a focused proof command for small
edits, and a broader interaction gate for behavior that crosses subsystem
boundaries.

Small docs-only or module-local changes do not need full workspace validation by
default. Run the focused proof for the touched feature, then add the broader
gate when the card's neighboring systems are affected.

### Commit Messages

This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). Every commit message must start with a type prefix:

| Prefix | When to use | Version bump |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `feat:` | New feature or capability | Minor |
| `fix:` | Bug fix | Patch |
| `docs:` | Documentation only | None |
| `refactor:` | Code restructure, no behavior change | None |
| `test:` | Test additions or changes | None |
| `chore:` | Build, tooling, dependencies | None |
| `security:` | Security fix | Patch |
| `perf:` | Performance improvement | Patch |

Add `!` after the type for breaking changes: `feat!: remove superseded API`.

Scopes are optional but encouraged: `feat(resolver): add SAT backtracking`.

Use the imperative mood in the subject line (e.g., "add sparse index support" not "added sparse index support"). Keep the subject under 72 characters. The release pipeline (`scripts/release.sh`, backed by `scripts/release-matrix.sh`) uses these prefixes to determine version bumps and generate changelogs.

## Development Workflow

GitHub is the day-to-day coordination surface for Conary work:

| Surface | What it owns |
|---------|--------------|
| Issue | Problem, in/out scope, acceptance criteria, current status, and follow-up work |
| Pull request | Proposed diff, review discussion, exact verification, and integration record |
| Roadmap | Ordered project state, blockers, and proof expectations across issues |
| Canonical docs and specs | Current product, operator, architecture, persisted-contract truth, and durable design decisions |

Issues and PRs link these surfaces together; they do not replace durable
repository documentation.

### 1. Start With An Issue

Search open and closed issues before creating a new one. Use the matching
GitHub issue type:

- **Bug** for behavior that differs from the supported contract.
- **Feature** for a new capability or user-visible improvement.
- **Task** for implementation slices, refactors, documentation, operations,
  releases, investigations with a deliverable, and project maintenance.

The issue should name the problem, in-scope and out-of-scope work, acceptance
criteria, owning subsystem or boundary, and expected proof. A broad initiative
may remain open across several focused PRs or use sub-issues; each PR still
names one primary issue.

Use Discussions while an idea is still exploratory. Pure read-only triage does
not need a new issue until it becomes proposed work. A truly trivial correction
such as spelling or a dead link may go straight to a focused PR, but `main`
still never receives a direct push. Report vulnerabilities through a private
security advisory, not a public issue.

### 2. Preserve The Project Gates

Run `bash scripts/agent-context.sh --feature <slug>` or
`bash scripts/agent-context.sh --path <file>` before feature-scoped work. Record
the owning boundary and focused proof in the issue, then preserve any design,
security, migration, compatibility, or maintainer-decision gate printed by the
feature card.

Create or update a tracked design or implementation plan only when the work
needs durable decision detail or spans multiple coordinated steps. Link it from
the issue. The issue owns work status; the document owns the durable decision
or execution detail. Completed planning is removed after its truth and resume
facts have moved to canonical owners, as described under Documentation Hygiene.

### 3. Branch From Current `main`

For a maintainer checkout:

```bash
git switch main
git pull --ff-only
git switch -c fix/42-rpm-parser-overflow
```

Contributors working from forks should refresh from `upstream/main` before
creating the branch. Include the issue number in a short descriptive name:

- `fix/42-rpm-parser-overflow`
- `feat/57-sparse-index`
- `docs/63-update-architecture` <!-- repo-path: hypothetical -->
- `chore/71-refresh-dependencies`

Do not commit or push repository changes directly to `main`.

### 4. Implement And Open A Pull Request

Keep each PR to one reviewable logical change. New features need focused tests;
bug fixes need a regression test that fails without the fix. Open a draft PR
early when the work is substantial or when review can help settle an active
decision.

Before pushing, run the focused proof and interaction gate selected by the
feature card. Broad changes should also run the full local CI path:

```bash
cargo fmt --all -- --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --exclude conary-test --verbose
cargo test -p conary-test --verbose
```

Add `cargo test -p remi` and `cargo test -p conaryd` when the change touches
service-owned code.

Every non-trivial PR names one primary issue:

- Use `Closes #42` only when merging the PR will satisfy the issue's acceptance
  criteria.
- Use `Refs #42` when the PR is one slice of a larger issue. Record the
  remaining work on the issue and leave it open.

The PR description explains the problem, scope, ownership boundary, user or
developer impact, exact verification commands and results, and any linked
roadmap, design, or plan.

### 5. Review, Merge, And Close

The default-branch ruleset requires changes to arrive through a PR, required CI
checks to pass, and every review thread to be resolved, including one an
automated reviewer re-posts for a finding already fixed. Reply on such a thread
with the fixing commit and resolve it rather than re-fixing; never merge over a
thread that is genuinely new. Respond to review feedback in the PR and keep its
verification section current after material changes.

The maintainer bypass is PR-only so an urgent merge still leaves an issue, diff,
discussion, and audit trail. Use it only when waiting for a required check would
cause more harm than merging, and record the reason plus replacement proof in
the issue and PR.

Merge through GitHub, then let GitHub delete the head branch. Confirm that the
issue closed when the PR used `Closes`; otherwise update the open issue with
what landed, what remains, and the next acceptance boundary.

## Issue Reporting

### Bug Reports

When filing a bug report, please include:

- Conary version (`conary --version`)
- Linux distribution and version
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- A reviewed support bundle when host state matters:
  `bash scripts/conary-support-bundle.sh target/conary-support-bundle`

The support bundle is allowlist-only and does not copy `conary.db`, raw logs,
environment dumps, shell history, private keys, SSH keys, `/etc/conary/trust`,
host-local access notes, or package payloads. Share raw `RUST_LOG=debug` output
only when a maintainer asks for it, and review/redact it before posting.

### Feature Requests

Feature requests are welcome. Please search existing issues first to avoid duplicates, and describe:

- The problem you are trying to solve
- Your proposed solution (if you have one)
- Any alternatives you considered

## Architecture Decisions

Conary has a few core design principles that inform how contributions should be structured. Understanding these will help your PR get accepted:

- **Database-first**: SQLite is the single source of truth for all package state. Do not introduce config files, caches outside the database, or in-memory-only state for data that should persist.
- **Content-addressable storage**: Files are stored by hash, enabling deduplication and efficient delta updates.
- **Explicit transaction and recovery boundaries**: Package operations record durable state in SQLite and use command-specific live-root journals or generation recovery paths. Keep failure handling fail-closed, and do not assume every host mutation has automatic rollback without focused proof.
- **Package-owned service surfaces**: Remi and conaryd live in their own app crates and should be built and tested directly with `cargo build -p remi`, `cargo build -p conaryd`, `cargo test -p remi`, and `cargo test -p conaryd`.

Before proposing significant architectural changes, please open an issue to discuss the approach. This helps avoid wasted effort and ensures alignment with the project direction.

## Documentation Hygiene

- Treat active docs as current-state references, not historical logs.
- Keep detailed roadmap state under `docs/roadmaps/`. Record durable design
  decisions in the architecture, module, or `docs/specs/` document that owns
  the affected surface. Track bounded multi-step execution in the primary
  issue and draft pull request; stable public or persisted contracts remain
  under `docs/specs/`.
- After canonical truth, proof, roadmap state, and resume facts are durable,
  delete completed, superseded, or abandoned planning. Use Git history for
  historical context; do not create a replacement planning archive.
- Run `bash scripts/check-doc-truth.sh` and the owning feature-card proof when
  editing a public claim or assistant-facing route.
- When editing files under `docs/`, update YAML frontmatter (`last_updated`, `revision`, `summary`) unless the file is intentionally exempt.
