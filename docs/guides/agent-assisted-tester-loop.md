# Agent-Assisted Tester Loop

This guide is for a person using a coding agent, such as Claude Code or Codex,
to help test the first Conary external preview loop. The agent should assist
with checks, commands, transcript capture, and issue drafting. The human tester
stays responsible for approving every command that mutates system state.

Use a disposable VM, a snapshot, or a non-critical host. Do not run this loop
first on an irreplaceable daily driver.

**Do not run this guide while its frontmatter status is `paused`.** Its
`v0.17.1` commands match the current immutable, independently verified suite,
and W7's ordinary-package gate has passed. The suite is not pinned
tester authority while the launch-status gates remain open. Resume only
after the canonical [launch status](../roadmaps/launch-status.json) assigns an
exact tester release, this guide names that same release, and the
[current release artifact matrix](https://github.com/FieldmouseWorks/Conary/blob/main/docs/operations/release-artifact-matrix.md)
still records that tag as published and independently verified.

## Copy-Paste Agent Prompt

The retained prompt below is inactive while this guide is paused. It assumes
the frontmatter has been changed to active and the displayed release has been
assigned as tester authority. Only then paste it into the agent running inside
the VM or snapshot:

```text
First read the guide frontmatter. If its status is paused, stop without
downloading or installing anything and explain that no current pinned tester
release exists.

I want you to help me run the Conary first external tester loop on this host.

Read this guide first:
https://github.com/FieldmouseWorks/Conary/blob/main/docs/guides/agent-assisted-tester-loop.md

Goal: install, inspect, update-preview, and remove a package whose source
format differs from this host's native package format with pinned Conary
v0.17.1, then draft a pre-alpha tester feedback issue. You are testing the user-facing
cross-distro package-manager flow, not developing Conary itself.

Safety rules:
- Stop immediately if this is not a VM, snapshot, or explicitly non-critical
  host.
- Confirm distro, architecture, kernel, and sudo before installing anything.
- Use only the pinned v0.17.1 release from
  https://github.com/FieldmouseWorks/Conary/releases/tag/v0.17.1 and confirm its
  release page provides the package for this host plus SHA256SUMS.
- Verify SHA256SUMS for every downloaded artifact before installation.
- Run dry-run commands before live commands when the loop provides both.
- Ask me before every non-dry-run command that mutates system state.
- If a command output is ambiguous, surprising, or scary, stop and ask.
- Keep a local transcript of commands, exit statuses, and notable output. The
  public feedback issue should summarize this transcript, not reproduce it.
- Do not upload logs, bundles, private keys, tokens, shell history, raw
  environment dumps, or Conary databases.
- At the end, draft a GitHub pre-alpha tester feedback issue using
  https://github.com/FieldmouseWorks/Conary/issues/new?template=pre_alpha_feedback.md.
```

If the agent is running from a Conary checkout, the same guide is also at
`docs/guides/agent-assisted-tester-loop.md`.

## Stop Conditions

Stop and do not install Conary if any of these are true:

- the human has not explicitly confirmed the host is disposable, snapshotted,
  or non-critical;
- the host is not Fedora 44, Ubuntu 26.04 LTS, or Arch Linux;
- the host is not `x86_64`;
- `sudo -v` fails;
- the pinned `v0.17.1` release page does not provide the package for this host
  plus `SHA256SUMS`;
- downloaded artifact checksums do not match `SHA256SUMS`;
- the agent or human cannot explain what a live mutation command is about to
  change.

Stop after installing and file a partial report if any live command fails in a
way the human cannot safely resolve. If Conary installed the test package,
preview its removal and ask before removing it when that remains safe.

## Preflight

Run these read-only checks:

```bash
cat /etc/os-release
uname -m
uname -r
sudo -v
```

Expected:

- Fedora 44, Ubuntu 26.04 LTS, or Arch Linux
- `x86_64`
- a stock distribution kernel
- working `sudo`

The basic package loop does not require the `mount.composefs` helper, loop
devices, UEFI, or special boot-stack support. When direct composefs mounting is
unavailable, transactions materialize the same verified current-generation
manifest and CAS authority as their isolated lower. OverlayFS remains a stock
kernel requirement for live mutation isolation. Composefs and the wider boot
stack matter only for generation-model features outside this test.

## Download And Verify

Create a clean work directory:

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/conary-preview-v0.17.1"
cd "$HOME/conary-preview-v0.17.1"
```

Download `SHA256SUMS` and the package for the current distro from:

```text
https://github.com/FieldmouseWorks/Conary/releases/tag/v0.17.1
```

Use exactly one package. Fedora 44:

```bash
base="https://github.com/FieldmouseWorks/Conary/releases/download/v0.17.1"
curl -fLO "$base/SHA256SUMS"
curl -fLO "$base/conary-0.17.1-1.fc44.x86_64.rpm"
```

Ubuntu 26.04 LTS:

```bash
base="https://github.com/FieldmouseWorks/Conary/releases/download/v0.17.1"
curl -fLO "$base/SHA256SUMS"
curl -fLO "$base/conary_0.17.1-1_amd64.deb"
```

Arch Linux:

```bash
base="https://github.com/FieldmouseWorks/Conary/releases/download/v0.17.1"
curl -fLO "$base/SHA256SUMS"
curl -fLO "$base/conary-0.17.1-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst"
```

Downloaded package names:

- Fedora 44: `conary-0.17.1-1.fc44.x86_64.rpm`
- Ubuntu 26.04 LTS: `conary_0.17.1-1_amd64.deb`
- Arch Linux: `conary-0.17.1-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst`

Verify the downloaded package against `SHA256SUMS`:

```bash
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS --ignore-missing
```

Expected: the downloaded package prints `OK`.

## Install Conary

Ask the human before running the matching install command.

Fedora 44:

```bash
sudo dnf install ./conary-0.17.1-1.fc44.x86_64.rpm
```

Ubuntu 26.04 LTS:

```bash
sudo apt install ./conary_0.17.1-1_amd64.deb
```

Arch Linux:

```bash
sudo pacman -U ./conary-0.17.1-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst
```

Then record:

```bash
conary --version
conary --help | sed -n '1,80p'
```

The package post-install step initializes one source-independent system
database and configures Remi plus the built-in RPM, Debian, and Arch source
feeds. The host distribution does not constrain source selection. Do not rerun
`system init`; inspect the configured sources and sync Remi instead:

```bash
sudo conary repo list
sudo conary repo sync remi
```

## Run The Tester Loop

Run each command in order. Ask the human before every command that is not a
dry-run and can mutate system state.

```bash
source=ubuntu-26.04  # Fedora/Arch hosts; use fedora-44 on Ubuntu
sudo conary install htop --from "$source" --dry-run
sudo conary install htop --from "$source" --yes
sudo conary list htop --info
sudo conary query depends htop
sudo conary update htop --dry-run
sudo conary remove htop --yes
```

The chosen source must use a different package format from the host: Debian on
Fedora or Arch, or RPM on Ubuntu. Conary validates `htop`'s exact typed
capability declaration against the selected target during preflight and
applies executor enforcement automatically. Unsupported requirements fail
before mutation. Review the complete dry-run first, then ask the human before
each live `--yes` command.

During the run, capture:

- command text;
- exit status;
- distro and kernel;
- source package format and host native package format;
- whether the full loop completed;
- where a partial run stopped;
- anything confusing, slow, scary, or unexpectedly pleasant.

## Report Feedback

Open a pre-alpha tester feedback issue:

```text
https://github.com/FieldmouseWorks/Conary/issues/new?template=pre_alpha_feedback.md
```

Fill in:

- **Preview Lane:** check "First external tester loop";
- **Completed the full loop:** `yes`, `no`, or `partial`;
- **Distribution:** Fedora 44, Ubuntu 26.04 LTS, or Arch Linux;
- **Source and host formats:** name both package formats and confirm they differ;
- **Kernel version:** output of `uname -r`;
- **Conary version or commit:** output of `conary --version`;
- **VM/snapshot/non-critical host:** `yes` or `no`;
- **Commands Run:** exact commands from the transcript;
- **What Happened:** short notes about results and friction.

Keep the public issue concise. Include exit statuses and only the output needed
to explain a failure, surprise, or useful result. Do not paste the complete
local transcript, a full installed-package inventory, or broad environment
output. Strip terminal color and control sequences before including excerpts.

Only attach a support bundle if it would help explain a failure and you are
running from a checkout. Review it first:

```bash
sudo -v
bash scripts/conary-support-bundle.sh target/conary-support-bundle
```

On an installed host, the script uses the cached authorization only for
allowlisted database-backed diagnostics and stops before writing if it is not
available. Do not attach private keys, tokens, SSH keys, shell history, raw
environment dumps, `/etc/conary/trust`, raw logs, package payloads, or live
`conary.db` files unless a maintainer explicitly asks for a separately reviewed
follow-up.
