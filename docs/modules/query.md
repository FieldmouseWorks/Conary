# Query Module (apps/conary/src/commands/query/)

Package, file, dependency, and repository queries against the local SQLite
database. Label management remains nested under `conary query`, while the
derivation-aware CycloneDX SBOM surface lives at the top-level `conary sbom`
command in `apps/conary/src/commands/derivation_sbom.rs`. The installed-package
database SBOM surface is `conary system sbom` and remains implemented in
`apps/conary/src/commands/query/sbom.rs`.

## Data Flow: Query Dispatch

```

  apps/conary/src/cli/query.rs -- Clap definition (QueryCommands enum)
        |
  apps/conary/src/dispatch/query.rs -- query namespace routing
        |
  apps/conary/src/commands/query/mod.rs -- Dispatch to handler
        |
  +-- depends / rdepends    -> dependency.rs   (DependencyEntry table)
  +-- deptree               -> deptree.rs      (recursive traversal, cycle detection)
  +-- whatprovides           -> dependency.rs   (provides/troves and repository_provides/repository_packages/repositories)
  +-- whatbreaks             -> dependency.rs   (reverse dependency impact)
  +-- reason                 -> reason.rs       (Trove.install_reason filter)
  +-- repquery               -> repo.rs         (RepositoryPackage table)
  +-- component / components -> components.rs   (Component + FileEntry tables)
  +-- scripts                -> scripts.rs      (package files plus installed scriptlet/bundle state)
  +-- system history        -> commands/query/history.rs (changesets plus lifecycle_events)
  +-- conflicts              -> dependency.rs   (file ownership overlap detection)
  +-- delta-stats            -> dependency.rs   (delta update statistics)
  +-- label                  -> cli/label.rs + dispatch/query.rs   (label path, delegation, and provenance management)

## Key Types

| Type | Source | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `Trove` | db/models/ | Installed package record (name, version, reason, pinned) |
| `DependencyEntry` | db/models/ | Typed dependency link (runtime, build, etc.) |
| `ProvideEntry` | db/models/ | Capability declaration (soname, pkgconfig, virtual) |
| `FileEntry` | db/models/ | Installed file (path, hash, perms, component) |
| `PayloadClaim` | db/models/ | Exact package claim over a materialized payload anchor |
| `PackagePayloadOwnership` | db/models/ | Exact package-facing payload, including shared claims whose materialized anchor belongs to a peer |
| `Component` | db/models/ | Logical subpackage (:runtime, :lib, :devel, :doc) |
| `RepositoryPackage` | db/models/ | Available package from synced repo metadata |
| `InstalledCcsRemoveHook` | db/models/ | Exact persisted CCS-authored pre-remove hook |
| `InstalledNativeLifecycleBundle` | db/models/ | Persisted source-ABI lifecycle authority for later query and transaction planning |
| `LifecycleEvent` | db/models/ | Typed per-changeset warn-and-continue lifecycle failure evidence |

## Whatprovides Output

`conary query whatprovides <capability> --json` emits a schema-version-1 JSON
object with `schema_version`, the requested `capability`, `providers`, and
`provider_count`. Each provider carries `source_kind`, a package object with
its exact name, version, nullable release and architecture, and version scheme,
a nullable repository object, and sorted unique capability versions. Repository
objects carry the persisted repository name and nullable `repository_identity`.

Installed providers precede repository providers. Within each source group,
providers are ordered lexically by package name, version scheme, version,
release, architecture, repository name, repository identity, and capability
versions; nullable tie-break fields sort as empty strings. Capability versions
are sorted lexically and deduplicated. An empty query returns the same root
object with an empty provider list and count zero. The text report is rendered
from the same provider result. A selected malformed provide or provider whose
required metadata lookup fails causes command failure before stdout is written.
Package architecture is reported from its stored record.

## Database Tables

Primary tables hit by queries:

| Table | Indexed On | Used By |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| `troves` | name, type | All queries |
| `dependencies` | trove_id, depends_on_name | depends, rdepends, deptree, whatbreaks |
| `provides` | trove_id, capability | whatprovides installed providers |
| `repositories` | name | whatprovides repository metadata, repository configuration |
| `repository_packages` | name, repository_id | repquery, whatprovides repository packages |
| `repository_provides` | repository_package_id, capability | whatprovides repository providers |
| `files` | path, trove_id, component_id | component, conflicts |
| `payload_claims` | path, trove_id | package-facing payload ownership, shared-anchor retention |
| `components` | parent_trove_id, name | component, components |
| `installed_ccs_remove_hooks` | trove_id | scripts |
| `installed_native_lifecycle_bundles` | trove_id, evidence_digest | scripts |
| `lifecycle_events` | changeset_id, sequence | system history |

## Query Patterns

- **Direct lookup**: `Trove::find_by_name()` for single-package queries
- **Relationship traversal**: JOIN across dependencies/provides/files
- **Pattern matching**: LIKE queries with wildcards on names and paths
- **Recursive traversal**: deptree uses HashSet-based cycle detection with configurable depth
- **Reverse lookup**: `WHERE depends_on_name = ?` for rdepends/whatbreaks
- **Package payload projection**: package, component, and installed SBOM views
  use `PackagePayloadOwnership` so every package's exact directory
  claims remain visible even when another package owns the materialized anchor
- **Scriptlet inspection**: `conary query scripts <path>` inspects native or CCS
  package files, while `conary query scripts <package> --db-path <db>` resolves an
  installed package and separates the exact CCS `installed_ccs_remove_hooks`
  contract from persisted `installed_native_lifecycle_bundles` entries with
  source slot and lifecycle phase metadata. Native entries are never projected
  into the CCS hook table. Text and JSON output identify installed bundle
  entries by source slot, lifecycle path, preservation decision, reason code,
  and evidence digest without printing preserved raw script bodies by default.
  The JSON bundle summary exposes `diagnostic_class_counts`; these counts are
  evidence for implementation prioritization and never lifecycle authority.

## Lifecycle Failure History

`conary system history` reads the ordered `lifecycle_events` rows attached to
each changeset and displays their typed package, entry, failure class, phase,
sandbox, and message fields.

## Related SBOM Commands

`cmd_derivation_sbom()` handles the top-level `conary sbom` command. It lives
outside this module tree in `apps/conary/src/commands/derivation_sbom.rs`
because it exports derivation/profile metadata rather than installed-package
query rows.

It produces CycloneDX JSON from derivation data, targeting either a single
derivation or a named profile.

Each component includes:
- Package URL (PURL): `pkg:conary/name@version?arch=x86_64`
- SHA-256 hash from first file entry
- Tool metadata (vendor: FieldmouseWorks, version from Cargo)

Output to stdout or file via `--output`.

`cmd_sbom()` in `apps/conary/src/commands/query/sbom.rs` handles
`conary system sbom`. That path reads the local package database and exports an
installed-package SBOM for one package or `all`; it is not the top-level
derivation SBOM command.

## Architecture Context

The query module is read-only -- it never modifies the database. All queries
run against the local SQLite instance populated by install/remove/sync
operations. Repository queries (`repquery`) hit the `repository_packages`
table, which is refreshed by `conary repo sync`.
