# Source Selection Module (conary-core/src/repository/ + conary-core/src/model/)

Source selection is the policy layer that decides which repositories are
eligible to satisfy a request and how allowed candidates are ranked once they
are eligible.

Conary now uses one shared source-selection model across install, update,
model diff/apply, and replatform planning instead of keeping separate policy
logic in each flow.

## Model Inputs

`[system]` owns only target ownership convergence. Distro pins, source
allowlists, and mixing settings are rejected as unknown fields. Source choice
belongs to enrolled repository identity and an explicit request scope, not to
a global system label. The `conary distro` command is therefore diagnostic:
`list` shows named feed presets and `info` shows measured installed affinity;
neither mutates selection policy.

## Runtime Mirrors

Conary persists source authority per repository through
`RepositorySourcePolicy`. `load_effective_policy()` starts with no ambient
source authority and binds one only from `--from`, `--repo`, or exact selected
root provenance. A native repository supplies its opaque, stream-bound
`source_identity`; static and Remi sources may project a named feed ID. Package
format is never a substitute: Fedora, Tumbleweed, Mint, and MX may share an
ecosystem with other sources without becoming interchangeable authorities.
Strict dependency resolution rejects a transitive candidate until one exact
transaction source identity is established.

`SystemAffinity` is a measured summary of installed-package provenance.
It is deliberately not an input to eligibility, candidate ranking, canonical
equivalence, update selection, or any other mutation decision. It exists for
informational display and to estimate how many installed packages a requested
replatform may need to realign.

The repository feed catalog makes
`crates/conary-core/src/repository/supported_profiles/` the source of truth for
configured feed IDs, package format, version scheme, typed target machine
architecture, and Remi route-family
mapping. Fedora 44, Ubuntu 26.04, and Arch are the public feeds, not the only
destination systems Conary supports. Solus is a candidate profile available to
private refresh and conformance work without public route, universe, key, seed,
or readiness authority. Internal route slugs
such as `fedora` and `ubuntu` are not feed IDs. The
`repo add --source-profile` surface accepts only those exact public IDs and
requires the declared profile's package format to match the repository parser.
Remi
sync and package fetches translate the stored public ID to the profile-owned
route slug. Remi sync verifies the endpoint-wide signed universe, downloads
only missing digest-addressed catalogs, and replays each configured
profile directly into one private immutable resolution index. One final fenced
transaction activates the complete index and its universe-bound canonical map.
Object transfer bounds each request and interval without body progress; it does
not impose a fixed wall-clock ceiling on a healthy multi-gigabyte stream.
Interrupted bodies use bounded retries and resume from retained bytes
when the server supports ranges. A complete-operation deadline belongs to the
caller. Private replay creates resolution indexes only after bulk row transfer;
the append-only candidate must retain a zero-page freelist and remains
unpublished through index construction, integrity verification, and durable
rename. Finalization does not rewrite the new multi-gigabyte database with a
no-op compaction pass.
The client rejects mixed revisions, rollback, forks, expiry, altered objects,
and a manifest that does not authorize the exact object set. Sync neither
fetches whole-distribution JSON nor retains distribution-sized package or
relation vectors in Rust. Persisted Remi package identity requires the exact
public ID; route slugs and generic `rpm`/`deb`/`arch` format labels are never
accepted as source-identity aliases. Native repository sync instead consumes
the persisted native source policy described below. A configured public
profile remains an optional feed preset during W10 and is copied into native
package rows when present; it is not required for repository identity or
refresh authority. The superseded distro catalog is absent.

Host-native admission derives `NativeMachineIdentityV1` only from compile-time
machine facts: `target_arch`, pointer width, endianness, and `target_abi` for
32-bit ARM float ABI. The executable's target triple is retained only for an
`UnsupportedNativeHostTarget` diagnostic; `target_env`, libc, and target OS do
not enter machine identity. Thus GNU and musl executables built for the same
x86_64 machine produce identical host identities, as do GNU and musl ARMv7
hard-float executables.

Package libc/ABI remains separate typed source-format authority. The
supported-profile registry declares Ubuntu's dpkg `gnu` ABI and Fedora/Arch's
implied glibc ABI. For RPM, Debian, and Arch, native-only admission derives the
target machine solely from the selected profile's typed `target_architecture`
and requires both package machine equality and package ABI equality with that
profile target. The host identity separately validates that the selected
profile is usable on this host; a different machine returns
`ProfileArchitectureMismatch` and never defines another package admission set.
Conary and Eopkg have no corresponding foreign-profile architecture authority,
so their repository candidates retain their explicit scheme-owned machine
matching and do not require a source profile. RPM and dpkg architecture tokens
remain format-wide because their pinned upstream tables define those
vocabularies. ALPM has no format-wide vocabulary:
`pacman.conf(5)` configures `Architecture` as `auto`/`uname -m` or an explicit
list, and libalpm compares package `%ARCH%` literally while always accepting
`any`. Each ALPM profile therefore declares exactly its own machine token set
plus `any`; a token outside that set is `UnknownArchitectureToken`, not a
silent non-native filter.

Repository selection keeps package-variant requests separate from host
assertions. A `PackageArchitectureVariant` selects the installed or explicitly
requested package variant; update and replatform derive it from the installed
package's source scheme. An architecture-independent installed variant selects
only an independent target variant, including the target scheme's corresponding
`noarch`, `all`, or `any` token during replatforming. A machine variant admits
that same machine identity plus the target scheme's architecture-independent
variant. `HostArchitectureAssertion` is a separate profile-bound check and may
contain only a machine token; an independent package token can never become a
host assertion. An unscoped package-variant request is validated against every
candidate's pinned scheme authority before architecture-independent matching;
ALPM uses the candidate's exact source profile for that validation. An unknown
token returns `UnknownArchitectureToken` and cannot match `noarch`, `all`, or
`any` by literal substitution.

The SAT provider applies that repository-row admission exactly once, when a
persisted row is promoted to a solvable. Excluded rows receive no `SolvableId`
and enter neither the package-name index nor the capability-provider set;
unknown architecture tokens fail that load with `UnknownArchitectureToken`.
All repository discovery converges on this boundary: requested and transitive
package-name searches, canonical-equivalent name expansion, exact persisted-ID
root candidates, demand-driven declared providers (virtual, soname, file,
path, binary, pkgconfig, pkgconfig32, COMAR, and generic), AppStream canonical
provider expansion, and the atoms used by same-provider expressions. Exact
root interning only constrains the already-admitted row by persisted ID. After
load, per-match architecture logic is limited to Debian dependency and provide
qualifier/Multi-Arch semantics; it does not repeat candidate admission.

Admitted solvables populate an exact capability-name index in the same owner,
`resolver/provider/mod.rs::add_solvable`, after all validation succeeds.
Repeated declarations contribute one candidate per capability name, and later
additions retain insertion order. SAT candidate lookup copies only the matching
IDs; it does not rescan every loaded package's complete provides list. The
index is private to one provider and changes no persisted facts, matching
rules, or candidate ranking.

An accepted Remi conversion remains server-owned work until the typed job
status reaches `ready` or `failed`. The client continues to observe `pending`
and `converting` jobs; it does not turn elapsed wall time into conversion
failure. Cancellation and complete-operation deadlines belong to the caller.
`RemiClientCore` owns the one decision over the typed job state, so a status
outside that contract is a typed rejection rather than an active job. Any
future client rebuilds on that same authority instead of restating it. Bounded
transport and 5xx retries stay separate from that decision: exhausting them is
a transport failure, not a conversion failure.

## Canonical Remi Trust Authorities

Authenticated source metadata and authenticated converted CCS output are
separate boundaries. `crates/conary-core/src/repository/remi_authority.rs`, its
embedded `remi_authority/catalog.toml`, and `universe-root.json` own the
release-tracked Ed25519 package keys and independent universe metadata root for
Conary's canonical Remi service. Package keys are selected only by the exact
`https://remi.conary.io` origin and one exact public profile ID. The universe
root is selected by that exact origin alone. A route slug, package format,
repository name, deceptive hostname, or non-root URL cannot select either
authority.

`conary system init` enrolls the release-tracked universe root and creates or
reconciles each Conary-owned Remi repository and its `repository_package_keys`
rows in the same transaction. An explicit `conary repo add` for the
canonical origin/profile pair enrolls both authorities transactionally. Neither
the package-key nor metadata-root option can override release-tracked canonical
authority.
Repeated initialization compares the semantic key set without rewriting its
sync timestamps. Signed-universe activation leaves the repository's CCS
package authority intact and stores Remi resolution rows only in the selected
private immutable client index. A same-name repository whose endpoint or
strategy is operator-managed is left unchanged.

Universe metadata trust remains independent of package authority. A
noncanonical endpoint requires an independently supplied
`--remi-metadata-root`, and replacement uses only a future root signed through
the already-enrolled TUF root chain. The canonical production ceremony root is
release-tracked at SHA-256
`558c112acc4fa71aa537f4027d9430399035a953af7f8acd18c8d198d4454c2c`;
canonical initialization and repository addition enroll it automatically and
idempotently. It is never derived from a CCS package key.

For a noncanonical Remi endpoint, `repo add` requires one or more authenticated
`targets.public` files through the repeatable `--ccs-package-key` option and
persists them transactionally with the repository. It never imports canonical
FieldmouseWorks keys from a profile name alone or accepts a key delivered by the
same unauthenticated package response. Install derives exact repository
provenance, admits only that repository's active keys, and fails closed for an
unknown or cross-profile signer. Retired keys remain history, not install
authority.

## Canonical Package Map Authority

Canonical package equivalence is mutation authority because it can make a
package under one source name satisfy a request made under another. Start with
`crates/conary-core/src/canonical/exchange.rs` for the Remi wire contract,
`canonical/rules.rs` for local exact contracts, and
`db/models/canonical.rs` for persistence rules.

Only two typed authorities can create an implementation mapping:

- `Contract`: a versioned local document containing literal canonical names,
  package names, and exact public profile IDs.
- `Remi`: one canonical-map object bound into the verified signed universe for
  the explicitly configured Remi endpoint.

The current schema permits one implementation for each
`canonical_id`/public-profile pair and rejects every other authority string.
One source package may intentionally implement multiple canonical identities;
reverse lookup of that package name is therefore ambiguous unless the caller
also supplies the canonical identity or selected profile. AppStream may attach one
globally unique application ID to an already-authorized mapping. Repology and
AppStream caches cannot create mappings, choose packages, or resolve conflicts.

Canonical map exchange is a versioned hard contract. The JSON document
requires:

- `schema_version: 1`
- a monotonic content `revision`
- the persisted rebuild timestamp as `generated_at` (`null` only for the empty
  revision-zero map)
- each canonical name's `kind`, optional `category`, and
  public-profile-to-package map

The browsing response remains checksum-bound, but Conary synchronization does
not fetch or persist it independently. The universe manifest binds its exact
digest, size, revision, and entry count; the client streams the object into the
same private candidate as every configured package catalog. Unknown fields,
unsupported schema versions, route aliases, unknown profiles, duplicate keys,
reordered entries, and conflicting mappings fail before the single universe
pointer transaction. Identical Remi data never demotes existing local
`Contract` authority; a local contract may supply the same mapping, and any
package-name disagreement rejects the complete candidate.

There is no persisted per-package override table. Cross-profile movement is an
explicit scoped request or replatform transaction, not a decorative ranking
side channel.

## Native Repository Declaration Discovery

`crates/conary-core/src/repository/declarations/` owns the lossless declaration
grammars that precede native repository enrollment. It reads APT one-line and
deb822 sources, DNF5 repo files, libzypp repository and service files, and ALPM
configuration with ordered includes from an explicit selected root. Documents
retain exact source and expose typed source locations, disabled state,
duplicates, variables, endpoint precedence, and include order. Unknown
authority, invalid UTF-8, and root escapes fail closed; libzypp extras that
upstream preserves are retained as uninterpreted evidence and refused by
authoritative discovery.

This layer is not trust, enrollment, persistence, or enablement authority. It
does not invoke a native manager or read a native database. The upstream
pins, grammar inventory, and consumer boundary are recorded in
[`docs/specs/native-repository-declarations.md`](../specs/native-repository-declarations.md).

## Native Trust-Import Planning

`repository/declarations/trust_import/` consumes discovered declarations and
reads only their explicit local key material below the same selected root. Its
strict JSON preview retains native declaration identity, enabled state, source
locations, certificate fingerprints, and separate Debian Release, RPM
metadata, RPM package, ALPM database, and ALPM package roles. An exact RPM
metalink can authenticate metadata but never substitutes for package-signing
authority.

The only dispositions are `importable`, `ambiguous`, and `unsupported`.
Implicit global trust, unpinned remote key sources, and an unbound ALPM keyring
are ambiguous. Disabled verification, permissive trust, optional package
signatures, missing or malformed key material, selector mismatches, and
selected-root escapes are unsupported. Neither status can silently become an
enabled persisted repository. This slice does not fetch, persist, enable, or
mutate; the pinned semantics and consumer boundary live in
[`docs/specs/native-repository-trust-import.md`](../specs/native-repository-trust-import.md).

Takeover consumes that preview plus explicit enrollment authority. Strict ALPM
declarations can proceed only when the sole ambiguity is the missing native
keyring binding and enrollment supplies exact pinned masters, certification
threshold, revocation input, and the same effective `SigLevel`. It never turns
an unsafe declaration or unrelated ambiguity into trust. The same takeover
path preserves enabled state, priority, parser inputs, projection bytes, and
follow-or-pin source policy for APT, DNF5, Zypper, and ALPM repositories.

## Native Source Identity And Update Policy

After declaration and trust-import planning, a native RPM, Debian, or ALPM
repository is enrolled with an exact source identity, a distinct repository
identity, a typed release/channel/rolling stream, and one closed update mode.
`RepositorySourcePolicy` is normalized in `repository_source_policies` and may
be scoped to one repository or shared by a repository group. Each
repository retains its own enabled state, priority, parser selectors, content
URL, ownership, and optional member pin. Authenticated roots are transient
refresh inputs; immutable source catalogs own their revision identity.

`crates/conary-core/src/db/models/repository/source.rs` owns repository
validation and persistence;
`crates/conary-core/src/db/models/repository/source/policy.rs` owns the typed
policy and schema-revision-31 stream binding; and
`crates/conary-core/src/db/models/repository/source/persistence.rs` owns typed
row decoding. The binding commits to the exact
source/repository/stream identity, endpoints, parser configuration, and
top-level metadata authority. Refresh recalculates it before network access,
so an endpoint, parser selector, or metadata trust-root change requires
explicit `repo add --replace` re-enrollment.

Native parsers stream package projections through `RepositorySnapshotSink`
together with the SHA-256 of the authenticated top-level bytes: ALPM's
served compressed database, Debian's verified cleartext Release payload, or
RPM's authenticated `repomd.xml`. Distribution-sized children are downloaded
to private files, hashed and sized before parsing, then decoded one record at a
time into private catalog SQLite state.
`follow` admits a new authenticated identity only within the unchanged stream
binding. `pin` additionally requires equality with the repository member's
persisted digest. Admission and package-row replacement share one SQLite
transaction, so refusal preserves prior rows and all four refresh timestamps;
no mutable latest-snapshot field is updated.

Public feed profiles remain presets and conformance fixtures, not native
source identity. Native enrollment therefore works for uncatalogued
third-party repositories without adding a profile. The complete persisted,
CLI, hard-cut, and recovery contract is
[`docs/specs/native-source-identity-policy.md`](../specs/native-source-identity-policy.md).

Native Debian ingestion retains Depends, Pre-Depends, Recommends, Suggests,
and Enhances using the same typed relation grammar, matching
[APT 3.2.0 NewVersion](https://salsa.debian.org/apt-team/apt/-/blob/3.2.0/apt-pkg/deb/deblistparser.cc).
ALPM binary dependencies and optional dependencies are read from desc as well
as a separate depends entry, matching the
[pinned libalpm database reader](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/pacman/pacman/-/blob/54d94116164b0b2202c6061c4a59c6f3e70820d8/lib/libalpm/be_sync.c).
Source parser projection 3 and profile schema 4 retire the incomplete earlier
catalogs. Envelope readers classify obsolete versions as typed rebuild states
before decoding their bodies; refresh skips obsolete profile reuse and reparses
under the new normalized-cache key.

### Remi Native Catalog Projection

Remi applies the same enrolled source, stream, parser, and trust decisions but
does not publish activated package metadata into its operational SQLite
database. Each accepted authenticated source becomes a strict immutable
`SourceSnapshotV1` plus standalone catalog. One deterministic
`ProfileRevisionV2` binds the ordered members, typed roles, precedence,
required state, and composed package
catalog for the public profile. Candidate construction is private; durable
content-addressed publication precedes one fenced active-pointer transaction.
A matching normalized projection cache can bypass native parsing only when the
stream binding, every authenticated child role/path/digest/size, every typed
root-derived parser bound, parser projection version, and catalog schema all
match. The freshly authenticated top-level root remains bound into the new
immutable source manifest, but wrapper-only signature or timestamp churn does
not change normalized catalog bytes. Cache hits materialize the independently
reopened catalog artifact without row replay; cache contents never replace
the immutable source manifest or active profile pointer as authority.
Catalog source/profile/repository IDs remain bounded printable ASCII. Typed
native capability names preserve exact upstream UTF-8, including non-ASCII
RPM provides and significant surrounding whitespace in file/path capabilities;
non-path names remain trimmed and control-free.

Private refresh, proof, and prewarm selection maps one profile ID to its
fenced active or explicitly selected candidate revision. Public serving adds a
separate required step: one active signed universe snapshot names the complete
public profile set and each revision, and `CatalogAuthority` reopens only
those selected revisions. Sparse, detail, search, statistics, package lookup,
download, and request-triggered conversion retain that selection for
their work. An active profile pointer alone grants no public authority.
Repository names, insertion or fetch completion order, route slugs, candidate
catalog contents, and operational package rows cannot select a source member or
silently fill an absent universe. The profile package record carries exact
source-member provenance; conversion also verifies the corresponding source
snapshot and holds the universe-selected profile revision through outcome
persistence.

Refresh may advance a profile pointer while old readers and conversions finish.
Reader pins, work pins, active pointers, and durable conversion pins form the
complete catalog-retention graph. A conversion cache key includes the exact
profile revision rather than a mutable profile label. Missing resources,
invalid pointers, or missing/mismatched pins are corruption and fail closed;
there is no fallback to the previous operational package-row projection.

## Native Repository Authenticity

Native source selection begins only after one typed trust contract authenticates
the repository grammar. `RepositoryTrustPolicy` in
`crates/conary-core/src/repository/trust.rs` is the persisted authority.
`trust/openpgp.rs` is a thin role-dispatch hub over three owners:
`trust/openpgp/store.rs` (trust-store layout and key-source transport),
`trust/openpgp/pinned.rs` (Debian/rpm-md/RPM pinned-certificate verification),
and `trust/openpgp/arch/` (pacman keyring grammar, trust snapshot, and ALPM
signature semantics). Parser construction, sync, package download, CLI repository
creation, Remi's admin API, and the hosted repository manifest all consume that
same tagged contract. There is no signature-check boolean, permissive mode,
runtime disable command, key lookup by short ID, or guessed key URL.

The supported chains are:

- Debian: a pinned Release certificate verifies the clearsigned `InRelease`,
  or the exact `Release` plus `Release.gpg` fallback. The signed Release
  SHA-256 and size authenticate the selected compressed `Packages` index; each
  package stanza's SHA-256 and size authenticate its `.deb`.
- RPM: repository metadata and packages have distinct authorities. Either a
  detached OpenPGP signature or an exact HTTPS metalink identity authenticates
  `repomd.xml`; its SHA-256 and size authenticate `primary.xml` and, by the
  same discipline, `filelists.xml`; primary metadata supplies exact package
  relations and generator-selected file providers and authenticates the RPM
  bytes; filelists supplies complete package file ownership; and an
  independently pinned package certificate verifies the RPM's embedded OpenPGP
  signature.
- Arch: one configured keyring source supplies the pinned master certificates,
  their certifications, packager certificates, and the companion
  `<keyring>-revoked` disabled-key list. An explicit threshold says how many
  distinct pinned masters must certify a packager key; the hosted Arch feeds
  require three of the current five masters, matching GnuPG's default
  `--marginals-needed`. `SigLevel` is represented directly: package signatures
  are required, database signatures are required or optional, and any
  signature that is present must be valid under `TrustedOnly`. `Never`,
  `TrustAll`, and optional package signatures are not representable.

### Arch Trust Snapshots

ALPM signature trust is not a pinned-certificate check, so it does not use the
same verifier as Debian and RPM. `ArchTrustSnapshot`
(`trust/openpgp/arch/snapshot.rs`) is the typed equivalent of a keyring
populated by `pacman-key --populate`: pinned master authority, certified
packager certificates with the certifying master set, subkey bindings,
revocation and expiry, disabled-key state, and one explicit trust-snapshot
time. `trust/openpgp/arch/verify.rs` evaluates a package or database signature
against that snapshot and reports pacman's own result classes
(`alpm_sigstatus_t` and `alpm_sigvalidity_t`); acceptance reproduces
`_alpm_check_pgp_helper` under `TrustedOnly`.

Two reference times are kept apart, because GnuPG keeps them apart:

- The **trust-snapshot time** (wall-clock now) decides certificate and subkey
  binding, key flags, revocation, and expiry. GnuPG builds the effective key
  from the *latest* self-signature (`g10/getkey.c:2914`, `:3427`) and compares
  expiry against `curtime` (`:3220`, `:3472`).
- The **signature creation time** is used only for the relations GnuPG ties to
  it (`g10/sig-check.c:363-435`): the signing key may not be newer than the
  signature, and the signature may not have expired.

Sequoia's streaming verifier instead binds keys at the signature's own
creation time. Because `archlinux-keyring` exports one self-signature per
component, every package signed before a packager's most recent self-signature
refresh looked unbound under that model while pacman accepted it. The typed
Arch verifier exists to remove that disagreement without loosening any check.

`crates/conary-core/tests/fixtures/arch/` holds a bounded real-package corpus
(the pinned `alpine-keyring` fixture plus packages from four more packager
keys, including a signing-subkey signer) and a bounded `archlinux-keyring`
ALPM package with the five pinned masters. Native pacman/GnuPG is the
conformance oracle for those recorded result classes; it is never invoked at
runtime or during tests.

The prepared Arch trust store is `<keyring-dir>/native/<repo>/arch/` holding
`certificates.pgp` plus `revoked`. It is disposable cache state: repositories
prepared before this layout must be re-prepared (`conary repo sync`, or Remi's
source prewarm), which refetches the keyring and rewrites both objects
together.

`crates/conary-core/src/repository/parsers/{debian,fedora,arch}.rs` owns the
three metadata chains. Fedora metalink identity parsing is isolated in
`parsers/fedora/metalink.rs`. It admits the current size and SHA-256 only from
their exact Metalink v3 namespace positions under the one `repomd.xml` file;
the typed MirrorManager `alternates` extension is historical evidence and
cannot establish or replace current authority. `repository/download.rs` owns
the terminal package checks. Missing keys, a missing required signature, an
unsupported hash, duplicate authority records, invalid certification
thresholds, or any identity mismatch fail closed and remove a partially
downloaded package.

The Arch repository parser and direct package parser share
`repository/package_relation.rs` as the ALPM relation authority. Runtime
dependencies and provisions are parsed through the official typed
`RelationOrSoname` grammar. Soname v1 and v2 values remain complete atomic
`Soname` identities; Conary never guesses a package-version boundary inside
them. Ordinary package relations retain their exact ALPM comparison semantics.

RPM requirement grammar is owned by
`repository/rpm_dependency.rs`. Its parser state is derived from RPM
`a8f0192aee1c08bd1454ed2ac6ebaf506004b55c`
[`rpmrichParseInternal()` and `rpmrichParseForTag()`](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/blob/a8f0192aee1c08bd1454ed2ac6ebaf506004b55c/lib/rpmds.cc#L1309-L1421),
not from dependency text or a package list. It accepts RPM's exact comparison
spellings and canonicalizes aliases before typed version evaluation; enforces
the same-operator chain and tag-context rules; and constructs repeated `with`
from the right side as RPM does. At authenticated RPM source ingestion only,
an empty serialized epoch (`:version`) is decoded as omitted epoch zero in
simple and nested rich atoms; canonical, user-authored, and persisted EVRs
remain on the strict non-empty decimal epoch grammar. The source-pinned Fedora
44 corpus under
`crates/conary-core/tests/fixtures/rpm/` proves real repository expressions
without granting those packages exceptional behavior.

RPM-MD prerequisite authority is part of that same signed dependency record.
Pinned `createrepo_c`
[`cr_xml_dump_primary()`](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/createrepo_c/blob/5cf41fe5d703901d78078ed18c67ab667e446c1a/src/xml_dump_primary.c#L80-L128)
emits `pre="1"` only for a Requires entry whose RPM dependency is an install
prerequisite. The Fedora parser preserves that marker as the typed
`PreDepends` relation; it does not infer order from a capability or package
name. Direct RPM parsing projects the corresponding header sense flags through
the same relation kind.

Native parity preserves those source declarations in the catalog while
projecting libsolv's exact prerequisite precedence in
`repository/catalog/parity/rpm_requirements.rs`. Package comparison and the
ephemeral candidate resolver share that projection, including canonical rich
dependency spelling from `repository/rpm_dependency/render.rs`. Its
`rpm_requirements/epochs.rs` owner applies shared native EVR spelling to every
operand and atom-index version while preserving positive epochs. The
adjacent `rpm_provides.rs` projects the native ordered set of declared provider
IDs and its indices while retaining original catalog provenance. The
[native parity contract](../specs/remi-native-parity-oracle.md) owns the pinned
rule and the requirement-hash binding; lifecycle consumers keep the original
source records.

RPM file authority is derived from `createrepo_c`
`5cf41fe5d703901d78078ed18c67ab667e446c1a`: its
[`cr_xml_dump_files()`](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/createrepo_c/blob/5cf41fe5d703901d78078ed18c67ab667e446c1a/src/xml_dump.c#L175-L225)
selects and emits package-owned `<file>` records in `primary.xml`, and its
[`STATE_FILE` parser](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/createrepo_c/blob/5cf41fe5d703901d78078ed18c67ab667e446c1a/src/xml_parser_primary.c#L428-L445)
reads them independently of `rpm:provides`. Conary preserves every such signed
record as an unversioned typed file provider with `source-derived-file`
provenance on the package. The projection is owned by
`repository/parsers/fedora/provides.rs`. It does not reimplement createrepo's
path-selection rule or infer providers from package names, payload guesses, or
a curated path list. The provenance names the source format only: the
capability is the path, so a path-owning provenance never restates it. At this
scale that is not a stylistic point -- a duplicated path is one extra copy of
every package-owned path in the distribution, in both the synced database and
every converted artifact's signed capability list.

That selection rule is a filter, so `primary.xml` is not complete file
ownership: the same generator writes every owned path through the same
`<file>` writer into `filelists.xml` with the filter off
([`cr_xml_dump_filelists()`](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/createrepo_c/blob/5cf41fe5d703901d78078ed18c67ab667e446c1a/src/xml_dump_filelists.c)).
Conary reads both documents. `repository/parsers/fedora/repomd.rs` admits the
`primary` and `filelists` records with one size plus SHA-256 discipline;
`repository/parsers/fedora/files.rs` owns the one `<file>` record grammar both
parsers read, so a path one document admits is never a path the other rejects;
`repository/parsers/fedora/filelists.rs` folds each `<package>` record into the
package `primary.xml` published, joined on `pkgid` (the package SHA-256), and
projects each path through the same `provides.rs` owner. A path both documents
carry becomes exactly one capability. The join is total: both signed documents
must name the same package set and agree on name, architecture, and EVR.
Directory and `%ghost` records are owned paths in both documents, so the
`type` attribute does not gate the projection.

A repository that publishes no `filelists` record is refused at sync when any
package carries a positive dependency that cannot be satisfied at all under
that filter. An RPM dependency name beginning with `/` is a dependency on a
path, so a path outside the filtered primary set has no possible repository
provider. The decision evaluates the requirement's typed boolean expression,
never its flattened alternatives: every unprovidable path atom is false, every
other atom may hold, and no atom is guaranteed to hold, so a conditional stays
satisfiable through its else branch. A group is refused only when the
expression cannot hold under that optimistic assignment, which refuses
`(cap and /unprovidable)` while admitting `(cap or /unprovidable)` and
`(/unprovidable if cap)`. Repeated atoms are evaluated independently, which can
only cost a warranted refusal and never invent one. The typed refusal names the
repository, the package, the paths, and the missing document instead of
surfacing later as an anonymous solver conflict. When filelists is published, a
missing path is an ordinary unsatisfied dependency.

Fedora 44 `Everything/x86_64` measures that cost exactly (repomd revision
1776864872): 76,354 packages, 81,720 file providers from `primary.xml`, and
9,416,909 more from `filelists.xml`, taking `repository_provides` from 657,873
rows to 10,074,782 and the synced SQLite database from 0.61 GB to 3.90 GB. The
829 MB decompressed document and repository-sized join maps are never
materialized: verified compressed files stream under the ceiling the signed
`<open-size>` declares, and complete pkgid membership is proven by indexed
candidate state.

Dropping the duplicated path from file provenance is measured on that same
corpus and revision: the synced database falls from 4.78 GB to 3.90 GB
(-18.3%), the persist phase from 446.3 s to 392.3 s (-12.1%), and peak process
RSS from 6.33 GiB to 5.15 GiB, with row counts identical. What remains is not
provenance: at 4.78 GB the `repository_provides` table held 2,332 MB against
1,684 MB of index (869 MB for `(kind, capability)`, 815 MB for `(capability)`,
127 MB for the package key), so every path is still stored once in the table
and twice more in indexes.

Index consolidation is the lever that answered. `capability` was the second
column of the `(kind, capability)` composite, so that index could never serve a
capability-only seek -- which is what every provider lookup issues -- and only
the single statement that also filters `kind` could use it. Schema revision 28
retires it. Measured on the same corpus and revision, with row counts identical
at 10,074,782: the synced database falls from 3,903,258,624 to 2,991,742,976
bytes (-23.4%), and the difference is exactly the 911,515,648 bytes the retired
index occupied, with the table (1,570,963,456), the capability index
(854,863,872), and the package key (133,562,368) byte-identical across the
pair. Peak process RSS is unchanged (0.2% across six runs): an index that is
not read during a sync costs disk, not resident memory.

The kind-filtering statement now seeks the capability index and filters the
rows one capability holds. No statement in the inventory falls back to a table
scan, before or after. The corpus bounds that filter exactly: its most-provided
capability is `/usr/lib/.build-id` at 20,494 providers, and 9,498,629 of the
10,074,782 rows are `file`, so the worst measured latency change is +6.7 ms on
a hot capability whose kind does not match, while an ordinary package lookup is
unchanged at 0.014 ms.

Persist-phase timing is deliberately not quoted for this change. Five
same-binary baseline syncs on this host ranged from 450.5 s to 952.4 s under
concurrent build load, a spread far larger than any delta worth claiming, so
the persist effect of maintaining one fewer index across 10M inserts remains
unpriced rather than estimated.

## Eligibility vs Ranking

Conary keeps eligibility and ranking separate:

- Eligibility decides whether a candidate may participate at all.
- Ranking decides which candidate wins among already-eligible candidates.

Eligibility inputs include:

- root request scope (`--repo`, `--from`)
- mixing policy (`strict`, `guarded`, `permissive`)

Strict mixing admits only the exact transaction source identity supplied by an
explicit source/repository scope or selected repository-backed root package.
Exact-root parity's missing-first conflict probe is owned by
`resolver/sat/hidden_conflict.rs`: it reuses loaded provider facts across fresh
SAT caches, with 64 re-solves and one monotonic 30-second deadline for the
whole probe. Exhaustion is a typed producer failure before classification;
it cannot become an unresolved or conflicting-closure outcome.
The policy-explicit SAT API rejects strict dependency solving when that
identity has not been established; it never treats an absent identity as an
empty candidate set and never derives
one from a package name, repository label, URL, or package format. Local files
with repository dependencies therefore require an explicit scope. A
declarative multi-root package set has no privileged root: its only implicit
authority is the one exact source identity common to every root's
version-compatible repository candidates. Disjoint or ambiguous identity sets
fail closed and require an explicit source scope; model order never selects
source authority. Guarded mixing prefers an established identity and may fall
back; permissive mixing does not add a source
preference. An exact installed
package-name or declared capability provider that satisfies a transitive
requirement is favored before repository ranking, so dependency planning does
not reinstall its repository copy. An explicit root with an exact package-name
candidate retains that root identity instead of being replaced by a differently
named installed virtual provider. Once eligibility and installed-provider
preference are fixed, repository priority is authoritative. Candidates at the
same priority are compared only with their source ecosystem's native version
scheme. Equal-priority candidates from different schemes, or candidates whose
exact native identity remains tied, produce a typed ambiguity. Repository
names, cache iteration order, and external discovery metadata never break that
tie.

Remi composes each activated immutable profile before serving it. Higher
member precedence selects provenance only when two members carry the same
native package identity and their payload and authoritative logical records are
identical; disagreement is a typed publication conflict. Debian distribution
and component are authenticated source-pocket provenance, exposed as
`DebianSourcePocketV1`, rather than source-independent package semantics. An
artifact may therefore collapse across security and updates pockets while
the selected higher-precedence record retains its typed pocket and member
origin. Intrinsic Debian metadata, payload identity, providers, dependencies,
conflicts, and replacements must still agree. Every distinct native version,
release, and architecture remains available to ordinary native version
selection. Catalog order and member ordinal are evidence locators, not
selection authority.

`crates/conary-core/src/repository/catalog/record/debian.rs` owns this typed
placement projection and its fail-closed metadata validation. Distribution and
component stay in the selected record's existing canonical metadata, so this
boundary changes profile comparison semantics without adding a second persisted
catalog field or schema.

Explicit version constraints remain strict and scheme-aware. Cross-distro
identity mapping helps find equivalent packages; it does not replace native
version constraint semantics.

## Native Lifecycle Source Identity

Source policy decides which package artifact may satisfy a request. Once an RPM,
Debian, or Arch artifact is selected, its typed package-manager lifecycle ABI is
part of that artifact's identity and is not reinterpreted by repository source
identity or a target distribution label.

The lifecycle bundle records the source format, distro, release,
architecture, and native version scheme. Packages with source lifecycle
programs carry those programs and their source ABI into the Conary-owned
runtime; packages without them carry no invented hooks. Source selection
cannot change either fact.

Install, update, replatform, and model apply all pass selected lifecycle bundles
to the same typed transaction planner. The planner derives slots, argv, trigger
matches, order, and payload visibility from package metadata and transaction
state. There are no operator replay flags, mixing-policy overrides, shallow
target matrices, or command-text exceptions. If the selected root cannot
satisfy a typed interpreter or source-manager semantic, preflight reports that
semantic before mutation so the missing model can be engineered.

Model apply resolves every install and update root together, authenticates the
exact SAT-selected repository closure, and executes that closure as one batch.
Typed package relations therefore order provider payloads and dependent
lifecycle programs inside one package-set transition; model diff iteration
order is never transaction authority.

## Dependency Acquisition Boundary

`repository/dependencies.rs` prepares the complete selected closure before any
package acquisition starts. Repository rows, native package trust, Remi route
identity, and Remi signing policy are resolved serially through the
caller-owned SQLite connection into immutable per-package plans. The network,
signature/checksum verification, and CAS portion then runs with at most eight
packages in flight and never owns or shares that connection.

Acquisition completion order is not transaction order. The downloader drains
every bounded task, restores the resolver-selected input order, and aggregates
attributable failures in that same order before returning. Install, update,
model apply, and replatform consumers therefore receive the identical package
and lifecycle sequence they received from serial acquisition; payload mutation,
database commit, lifecycle execution, and generation publication remain outside
the concurrent boundary.

## Flow Behavior

### Native Package Adoption

Native repository takeover is a separate authority transition from package
adoption. `conary system repository-takeover --dry-run --root <selected-root>
--manifest <enrollment.json>` serializes the complete declaration, trust,
identity, policy, and projection plan without mutation. Apply requires that
exact preview SHA-256 and `--yes`; rollback restores the persisted prior
projection bytes and removes only takeover-owned repository rows. Native
declaration paths remain byte-identical compatibility projections, and any
missing or changed path is reported as drift rather than becoming new
authority. Legacy APT declarations without `Signed-By` can proceed only when
the enrollment manifest binds exact primary fingerprints to native global
keyring bytes below the selected root; the keyring files then join the owned,
rollback-safe projection set. The contract is
[the native repository takeover specification](../specs/native-repository-takeover.md).

After takeover, repository declarations and trust roots installed by a package
participate in the package's selected-root and SQLite transaction. CCS carries
the signed desired-state intent; direct native installation derives the same
intent from package payload grammars before mutation. Update, removal,
explicit retention, shared ownership, and rollback follow
[the package repository enrollment specification](../specs/package-repository-enrollment.md).
The completed filesystem is never scanned for repository-looking files.

`conary system adopt <pkg> --dry-run` builds the same package-specific plan
that apply consumes. The preview opens an existing current-schema database
read-only and never migrates it. Native discovery captures one typed
`InstalledInventorySnapshot` for the selected RPM, dpkg, pacman, or eopkg
authority. Each backend uses a fixed number of manager processes and bulk
database traversals independent of package count. The snapshot owns exact
identities, versions, architectures, install reasons, files, dependencies,
provides, configuration/lifecycle evidence, the complete path-to-owner map,
and a deterministic token over every mutation-relevant field.

Each requested package is classified as ready, already tracked, missing,
ambiguous, unsupported, or blocked by a tracked-file conflict. Shared
directories keep their existing owner instead of being reassigned. `--full`
also validates that every planned regular file or symlink is readable for CAS
capture, but preview never creates CAS state.

Adoption preserves migration continuity for a machine that already has native
package-manager state. It is not Conary's foreign-package acquisition path and
does not prove source-independent cross-distro conversion or lifecycle
execution.

`conary system adopt <pkg> --convert` is the explicit bridge from that
migration state to a portable CCS artifact. It selects the adopted trove by
exact name/version/architecture, requires its persisted native identity and
complete `AdoptedFull` payload ownership (`conary system adopt <pkg> --full`
establishes it), and resolves one exact package row from an enabled,
stream-bound enrolled native repository. The artifact is acquired into the
Conary cache under its typed authenticated source-digest authority; eopkg
retains the index's SHA-1 while conversion separately computes the internal
SHA-256 artifact identity. Cached RPM, Debian, Arch, and eopkg artifacts are
reverified with their ecosystem-specific package authority before reuse. The
parser identity and every adopted payload node,
resolved owner, content digest, symlink, hardlink topology edge, and explicit
directory must match before the native converter runs.

Conversion does not transfer ownership of the currently adopted trove. It
publishes a separately installable signed CCS under the Conary runtime root and
records that path only after immediate strict verification. Same-directory
staging plus one SQLite transaction ensures a failed conversion or persistence
step leaves neither a newly published artifact nor an applied changeset. A
later install, update, rollback, or remove consumes that CCS through Conary's
ordinary source-independent transaction path without consulting the source
package manager or its database.

System-wide adoption preserves the native manager's explicit-versus-dependency
reason for every installed package. On RPM systems, Conary uses each
generation's documented frontend authority. DNF5's
`repoquery --userinstalled` is itself an installed-only selector, while DNF4
composes `repoquery --installed --userinstalled`. Configured excludes are
disabled through the corresponding generation's documented option. RPM hosts
without DNF use libzypp's exact `/var/lib/zypp/AutoInstalled` `SolvIdentFile`;
each listed package ident is dependency-installed and every absent installed
ident is explicit. A missing authority or malformed result is a typed failure;
Conary never treats every RPM as explicitly installed.

Apply consumes that plan, rechecks file ownership inside its database
transaction, and reacquires the complete native inventory immediately before
commit. Any package, version, ownership, reason, relation, configuration, or
lifecycle token change aborts the transaction before handoff. Only an unchanged
snapshot may write checkpoints, package metadata, CAS objects, changesets, and
the state snapshot. Track and full adoption both preserve native
package-manager authority until an explicit takeover or selected-generation
handoff. Takeover consumes the same snapshot from planning through CAS upgrade,
revalidates it before transfer, and removes complete RPM, dpkg, pacman, or
eopkg identity sets through one database-only batch transaction where the
manager supports it.

Complete, unfiltered `conary system adopt --system --full` scans the selected
root exactly once. Package claims bind to that one path-indexed capture rather
than rereading their declared file lists. The scanner reports paths examined,
unique regular inodes, and content streams; every hardlinked inode is read into
CAS once, and its global typed topology is retained even when different native
packages own different links. Shared directories retain every package
owner, and unowned content is classified during the same traversal. The scan
captures each walked node through a bounded pointwise-stable descriptor window,
then derives global hardlink topology from the captured snapshots. It
uses the same finite publication domains as generation construction: `/etc` is
config state, `/var` and `/srv` are mutable state, and other retained top-level
paths are immutable generation input. `/proc`, `/sys`, `/dev`, `/run`, `/tmp`,
`/home`, `/root`, `/mnt`, and `/media` are the exact ephemeral/API/device/user
domains and are never captured. Conary's own runtime root and database
directory are explicit normalized exclusions under both their lexical and
resolved paths, so path aliases cannot make the CAS or database inputs to their
own capture. A runtime root resolving to `/` fails closed.

Persisted package file anchors and payload claims partition that scan.
Package-owned paths retain their owner and claim graph while their materialized
node/content authority is reconciled to the one global scan, preserving xattrs
and hardlinks even when an inode group crosses ownership boundaries. Every
remaining path belongs to one synthetic `CapturedRoot` trove. That source is a
generation input but never substitutes for package install, update, remove, or
native-manager authority. A repeated full adoption recognizes the same
partition without accumulating another captured-root owner. Track-only native
troves are privately CAS-backed and promoted to `AdoptedFull` in the same
full-adoption transaction.

The synthetic trove uses the fixed Conary-authored identity
`conary-live-root=0.0.0-captured-root`; both its trove version and exact package
provide are validated under Conary's SemVer grammar before persistence.
Pre-alpha databases containing the retired invalid `snapshot` version are
disposable authority: rebuild the database and repeat full adoption. There is
no compatibility adapter for that contradictory typed state.

Package filters and `--explicit-only` deliberately do not assert whole-root
continuity: they adopt only their requested native package scope. If any exact
native query, payload capture, or package persistence fails, full-system
adoption reports an incomplete outcome and does not classify the missing
package's paths as unowned captured-root state. Complete capture also fails
closed if a metadata-only `AdoptedTrack` identity is absent from the current
native inventory, because retaining that stale non-generation owner would
silently omit its paths.

### Install

Install uses the shared effective policy and then layers root-only request
scope such as `--repo` or `--from` on top of it. `--from` accepts only an
exact lexically valid source identity and does not consult the named feed
catalog. A named feed ID may additionally enable canonical-name projection;
unknown identities use literal package names. Literal-name selection
and SAT ordering both respect the effective source-selection settings.

### Update

Update now also loads the shared effective policy.

Ordinary update is exact-source only: it may select a newer native version from
the installed repository or exact public profile, but it never infers a distro
migration. Repology status cannot switch the source. Moving an installation
from one distro profile to another is an explicit replatform plan with separate
preview, selected target rows, and confirmation.

Update also enforces the limited-preview ownership boundary:

- Conary-owned updates always delegate to the same selected-root transaction
  used by `conary install`. When no current generation exists, that transaction
  materializes authoritative DB/CAS state and publishes the first generation;
  it never mutates the host root in place.
- Adopted packages keep native package-manager authority under the default
  `satisfy`/`adopt` behavior. Update reports the skip with native-PM guidance
  instead of silently replacing the package.
- `--ownership takeover` is the explicit package-level ownership crossing.
  Package names do not create special takeover exceptions; compatibility and
  dependency proof come from the selected package and typed provider graph.
- `--security` only proceeds when each requested Conary-owned update source is
  marked as publishing supported advisory metadata. Sources marked `unknown` or
  `unsupported` cause a refusal before mutation, so security-only output never
  implies completeness for a source that cannot answer advisory questions.

### Model Diff / Apply

Model files do not own global source-selection state. Model diff/apply operate
on packages, ownership convergence, and explicit replatform actions;
repository enrollment and request-scoped selection remain source authority.

`model apply --dry-run` resolves the complete incoming package set, downloads
and authenticates its artifacts, and runs the same read-only batch
ordering and relation planning that apply consumes. It stops before
selected-root materialization, selected-root-relative payload normalization,
lifecycle execution, CAS storage, or database mutation, and returns the same
typed ordering error apply would return for an invalid prepared transaction.

### Replatform Planning

`model/replatform.rs` uses the shared source-selection and package-selection
logic to find visible realignment targets and build a
`ReplatformExecutionPlan`.

Measured `SystemAffinity` contributes only diagnostic package counts. The
proposals and executable transactions are derived independently from an
explicit target source identity, authenticated repository metadata, exact
package identity, dependency constraints, architecture compatibility, and
available install routes. Affinity percentages never choose or rank a mutation
candidate.

Each transaction tracks:

- target repository metadata
- pinned-version install route availability
- architecture compatibility
- unresolved target dependencies
- whether remove, install, and metadata legs are ready

This makes the plan useful both for preview output and for deciding which
replatform replacements can execute immediately.

## Operator Entry Points

The main CLI entry points are:

```bash
conary distro list
conary distro info
```

`conary distro list` shows named feed presets, not a destination support list.
`conary distro info` shows measured source-affinity data. Both commands are
informational; source choice requires enrolled repository authority and an
explicit scoped install, update, or replatform operation.
