# Remi native full-catalog parity oracle

## Boundary

The native full-catalog parity oracle is independent release evidence for one
`ProfileRevisionV2`. It is distinct from the hosted
`phase4-native-pm-parity` suite: that suite proves deterministic one-package
lifecycle and CLI behavior, while this contract covers every package admitted
to one immutable profile candidate.

The supported-profile registry is the sole target-architecture authority.
Its closed `ProfileTargetArchitecture` value declares Fedora 44 `x86_64`,
Ubuntu 26.04 `amd64`, and Arch `x86_64`; profile-revision schema 4 carries that
typed value into every `ProfileRevisionV2`. Profile catalog projection version
4 is the only current producer. Earlier profile schemas are typed rebuild
states before current-body decoding. Source parser projection 3 restores the
Debian weak relations and ALPM desc dependencies omitted by older ingestion;
projection versions 1 and 2 must be rebuilt from authenticated sources. There
is no compatibility reader.

## Input handoff

The production native producers consume `NativeOracleInputSetV1`, not mutable
mirror state or Conary's normalized catalog bytes. The strict schema-1 bundle
binds the canonical ordered Fedora 44, Ubuntu 26.04, and Arch private candidate
revisions, every ordered `SourceSnapshotV1`, and the digest-sorted union of
their authenticated native metadata objects. Candidate construction retains
each authenticated object as a digest-named file inside the immutable source
bundle. Export independently reopens that bundle, resolves only those retained
paths, and copies an object only after its SHA-256 and size match. It
performs no upstream network request or URL reconstruction. Debian Release
member names remain distribution-relative for signed SHA-256 lookup, while
the recorded `source_path` preserves the exact `dists/<distribution>/` prefix
that identified the authenticated object during candidate construction.

The writer publishes canonical `manifest.json` plus digest-named files beneath
one `objects/` directory, synchronizes and atomically renames the complete
bundle, then independently reopens every byte. Extra or missing entries,
symlinks, noncanonical JSON, object tamper, and candidate supersession fail the
operation. The bundle is an input carrier only; the pinned ALPM, libsolv, or
apt-pkg implementation remains the sole native fact and resolution authority.

The protected production producer accepts only one successful export
run. It independently reopens the transport and deployment evidence and
requires the artifact-owned deployed commit to be merged. The export's
canonical operator attestation must bind its run ID, attempt, workflow
commit, export identity, and `protected-pinned-known-hosts-v1` contract. An
older export without that attestation cannot become strict oracle authority.
The export operator must equal freshly fetched protected `main` at initial
authorization and immediately before SSH. Production accepts the export only
when its run head equals the producer workflow's own current-main commit,
so rerunning a historical workflow cannot mint new input authority.
Dispatch also names
one explicit full `producer_commit`; operators use the deployed commit by
default and name a newer commit only for an intended producer advance. The
workflow fetches `origin/main`, requires the producer commit to descend from
the deployed commit and already be an ancestor of `origin/main`, then checks
out that clean tree separately from the protected workflow/operator
checkout. Floating branches, workflow heads, malformed SHAs, unmerged commits,
non-descendants, and dirty producer trees are inadmissible.
`scripts/verify-native-oracle-producer.py` owns this reusable full-SHA,
fetch, and two-direction ancestry predicate for protected native-oracle and
resolution-survey producers; workflows may not fork a weaker local version.
Three pinned container lanes derive every member and object argument from the
canonical input contract: Fedora 44 uses libsolv 0.7.36, Ubuntu 26.04 uses
apt-pkg 3.2.0, and Arch uses the pinned archive/libalpm image. A lane succeeds
only after both its package-fact producer and exact-architecture resolution
producer complete their strict output reopen. Short-lived sanitized evidence
binds both manifests and artifacts to the input manifest, profile revision,
export identity, implementation version, architecture, deployed commit,
producer commit, and independently recomputed SHA-256 digests of both producer
binaries.
The operation is read-only and carries no refresh, conversion, proof,
activation, or public-pointer authority.

The accepted producer-binding decision deliberately separates immutable input
authority from producer implementation provenance. A merged descendant may fix
producer-only behavior without forcing a semantically identical Remi deploy
and export, while the export continues to own every candidate, source,
and metadata byte. Merged provenance alone grants no schema latitude: package
schema 1, resolution schema 3, and every ecosystem implementation/projection
pin remain mandatory. A three-lane set may contain different producer
commits per lane only when each is a merged descendant of the same deployed
commit and every lane passes those identical pins; each lane records its own
commit and binary digests.

Every selected production lane produces diagnostics before deciding strict
authority. It reopens one staged export, creates and reopens the package
oracle once, and invokes the resolution producer once with both `--survey` and
`--output`. One `EveryExactPackage` walk feeds both the strict writer and survey
collector, using the survey collector's explanation limits. The survey is
written even when roots fail. A failed root aborts strict output while collection
continues through every root; the strict output directory must not exist when
`total_failures` is nonzero. Only a failure-free walk finalizes, independently
reopens, and publishes the strict bundle. Single-destination calls retain their
strict-only or survey-only behavior. Survey findings cause
the combined process to return non-zero after writing; the lane adapter accepts
that status for recorded root failures or a typed strict-finalization failure.
A completed survey and walk implementation evidence remain independently
available when strict finalization or publication fails, including a destination
created by another producer during the walk. The CLI writes the implementation
evidence before reporting that distinct failure. The lane retains the survey
binding manifest and reports `strict_finalization_failed`, without publishing
strict lane evidence. Existing competing output is never replaced or deleted. A strict
failure still fails the lane and emits no strict lane artifact, but it cannot
discard an already validated survey. Survey artifacts are named separately,
carry the export/deployment/producer/image/schema/implementation/binary-digest
bindings, and remain diagnostics-only. Their type can never satisfy assembly,
comparison, promotion, activation, or publication.

Native-resolution survey binding evidence is schema 3, strict native-oracle
lane evidence is schema 5, and the assembled three-lane set is schema 2. The
lane schema embeds resolution schema 3; the assembled-set schema binds those
current lane summaries. The survey and lane versions also require the worker count,
per-worker pool-load timings, measured worker RSS, and admitted memory budget.
This is a hard cut: survey bindings through schema 2, strict lanes through schema 4,
and schema-1 assembled sets are obsolete non-authority and must be regenerated.
In particular, the first
subset production after this cut must rebuild all three strict lanes before
later subset runs may retain an unselected lane.

Dispatch input `lanes` is an optional comma-separated, non-empty,
duplicate-free subset of `fedora-44,ubuntu-26.04,arch`; its default is that
complete canonical set. Each successful strict artifact is named by exact
export identity, lane, and producer commit. Assembly always requires exactly
one strict artifact for each canonical lane. A selected lane must come from
the current run. For each unselected lane, assembly queries Actions artifacts
and chooses the newest unexpired artifact with the exact export/lane prefix,
then requires its exact producer job to have succeeded in a completed
protected-main production run. It verifies the API-recorded SHA-256 of the
downloaded archive before safe extraction and independently reopens every
canonical evidence, manifest, and artifact digest.

All three lane records must bind the same export run, export identity,
transport digest, deployment run, deployed commit, and input manifest. Each
producer commit must separately satisfy deployed-to-producer-to-`origin/main`
ancestry. Mixed descendant producer commits are accepted as decided above;
package schema 1, resolution schema 3, lane images, implementation versions,
and projection schemas remain identical per lane contract. Different exports,
non-descendants, unmerged producers, digest drift, missing or duplicate lanes,
and survey substitution fail closed. The assembled evidence records each
source workflow artifact ID/run/name/archive digest, lane evidence digest,
producer commit, both producer binary digests, and both strict oracle binding
records.

`NativeParityOracleV1` is the sole parity manifest authority. It binds the
exact profile revision digest, profile logical digest, ordered source members,
member roles and precedence, pinned native implementation and version, oracle
projection schema, normalized fact counts, and the SHA-256 and size of the
line-oriented package artifact. Unknown fields and unsupported schemas fail
closed.

Each `NativeParityPackageV1` row carries:

- exact package identity, source profile, version scheme, and architecture
  variant;
- the exact contributing source member and authenticated snapshot;
- source artifact checksum, size, and download authority;
- typed providers; and
- grouped positive and negative requirements, including conflicts, breaks,
  replacements, and obsoletes.

Package architecture is validated before a native package row can enter the
oracle writer. RPM and Debian boundaries require the exact token to exist in
their pinned format-wide tables. ALPM boundaries require the exact token in
the source profile's declared set: its target architecture plus `any`.
`NativeParityPackageV1` validation repeats the same profile-aware guard on
reopen. An absent token returns typed
`UnknownArchitectureToken { scheme, token }` before any resolution evidence
can exist; it is never normalized, admitted, or treated as a non-native
package.

The checked-in architecture fixtures pin the source authority without runtime
parsing or test-time fetches:

- RPM 6.0.1 `rpmrc.in` at tag `rpm-6.0.1-release`, commit
  `58a917a6c5e24e9e8a01976c17d2eee06249b9b6`, contributes every
  `arch_canon`, `arch_compat`, and `buildarch_compat` line from
  [the pinned upstream file](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/blob/rpm-6.0.1-release/rpmrc.in).
  The pinned Fedora 44 image ships `rpm-6.0.1-2.fc44.x86_64`.
- dpkg 1.23.7 tag `1.23.7`, commit
  `ef4d59f5925661818484ac666014ee3e665aadcf`, contributes
  [upstream data/cputable](https://git.dpkg.org/cgit/dpkg/dpkg.git/tree/data/cputable?h=1.23.7)
  and
  [upstream data/tupletable](https://git.dpkg.org/cgit/dpkg/dpkg.git/tree/data/tupletable?h=1.23.7).
  The pinned Ubuntu 26.04 image ships `dpkg 1.23.7ubuntu1`.
- The Arch producer pins `pacman 7.1.0.r9.g54d9411-2`; its installed
  `CARCH=x86_64` derives from
  [`etc/makepkg.conf.in`](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/pacman/pacman/-/blob/54d94116164b0b2202c6061c4a59c6f3e70820d8/etc/makepkg.conf.in)
  at commit `54d94116164b0b2202c6061c4a59c6f3e70820d8`.
  [`pacman.conf(5)`](https://man.archlinux.org/man/pacman.conf.5.en#Architecture)
  defines `Architecture` as `auto`/`uname -m` or an explicit list, and the
  [pinned libalpm comparison](https://gitlab.archlinux.org/pacman/pacman/-/blob/54d94116164b0b2202c6061c4a59c6f3e70820d8/lib/libalpm/trans.c#L69-106)
  compares `%ARCH%` literally while admitting `any`. The supported `arch`
  profile therefore owns `x86_64` plus `any`; the 2026-08-02 databases in the
  fixture header prove that profile snapshot rather than a format-wide
  vocabulary.

Conformance tests parse those vendored files and require every RPM table token,
every dpkg CPU and tuple expansion, and every pinned Arch package `arch` value
to project to a typed class. Tokens outside the supported x86_64/amd64 machine
profiles, including Debian `x32` and RPM micro-architecture levels, remain
known typed non-native classes rather than literal fallback values.

Rows are canonical JSON ordered by the profile package key. The writer
and verifier retain one complete package projection at a time; neither may
construct a profile-sized package or relation collection.

## Independence

Native extraction uses the pinned native package-manager implementation named
by the manifest. Conary catalog projection may serialize and verify the strict
contract, but it cannot serve as the evidence producer for release parity. A
catalog logical digest proves deterministic Conary output, not independent
native agreement.

The ALPM producer is built only with the explicit
`native-alpm-oracle` feature, reads profile-member database artifacts
through pinned upstream Rust bindings to libalpm, and records the linked
libalpm runtime version. Ordinary Conary and Remi builds do not acquire a
libalpm dependency. The helper may share the strict oracle serializer and
typed fact vocabulary; it may not read Conary catalogs, Conary Arch parser
output, or operational repository SQLite as native evidence.

The producer takes one `SourceSnapshotV1` and one local database file for each
profile member in ordinal order. The source-snapshot manifest digest must
match the member binding. Separately, the database bytes must match the
`ArchDatabase` authenticated-object digest and size inside that snapshot; the
two digests describe different objects and are never substituted for one
another. The snapshot's content URL, or metadata URL when no content URL is
declared, owns package download authority.

ALPM and Debian package producers populate their bounded private SQLite row
spools in one transaction. Duplicate selection, contradiction checks, and
complete native-row accounting finish before that transaction commits and the
output directory is created. Final oracle bytes still use the synchronized
streaming writer and complete independent bundle reopen. The temporary staging
transaction changes no persisted schema, native projection version, or output
identity.

Build and invoke the host-linked helper explicitly:

```bash
cargo run -p conary-core --features native-alpm-oracle \
  --bin conary-alpm-oracle -- \
  --profile-manifest profile.json \
  --source-snapshot core-source.json --database core.db \
  --source-snapshot extra-source.json --database extra.db \
  --source-snapshot multilib-source.json --database multilib.db \
  --output alpm-oracle
```

The helper registers the verified databases with libalpm in profile precedence
order. Every package returned by libalpm is projected or participates in
conflict-checked deduplication; there is no skip input. A private bounded spool
orders selected rows by package key without retaining the complete profile in
Rust memory. Success means the two-file bundle has been durably written and
independently reopened through the strict shared verifier.

ALPM soname-v1 provides containing `=`, including `libacl.so=1-64`, are atomic
soname identities rather than package-version relations. libalpm's generic
dependency handle exposes the same bytes as a name, equality mode, and version;
the producer requires those fields to reconstruct the exact native text, then
uses the pinned ALPM grammar's soname classification as semantic authority.
Soname-v2 identities remain atomic by the same rule. Ordinary package and
virtual relations continue to require exact normalized libalpm name and version
agreement, so this distinction adds no permissive fallback.

RPM package-fact evidence is produced only with the explicit
`native-rpm-oracle` feature and pinned libsolv 0.7.36 runtime. Ordinary Conary
and Remi builds do not acquire a libsolv dependency. For every profile member
in ordinal order, the producer requires one `SourceSnapshotV1` that
binds exactly the compressed `RpmPrimary` and `RpmFilelists` objects in that
order. It copies both objects to private staging, independently verifies their
authenticated sizes and SHA-256 digests, and only then lets libsolv
reopen the staged bytes with filelists extending the primary solvables.

The producer projects every libsolv package and variant, payload location,
SHA-256 and size, declared and complete file providers, required and
prerequisite relations, recommends, suggests, supplements, enhances,
conflicts, and obsoletes. Rich dependency trees are decoded through libsolv's
typed relation IDs and must agree with Conary's canonical typed RPM grammar;
native display text alone cannot establish parity. The producer derives its
canonical RPM text from that typed tree, flattening only RPM's right-associated
`with` spine and retaining parentheses wherever omission would change
association. It reparses that lossless text through the canonical RPM grammar
and requires typed agreement. The typed source projection canonicalizes
RPM's empty serialized epoch and explicit epoch zero to omitted epoch zero,
while retaining positive epochs and the strict persisted grammar.
Source catalogs retain the original requirement declarations and text. Native
package comparison and the ephemeral Conary resolver database share the RPM
projection in `repository/catalog/parity/rpm_requirements.rs`: source text must
parse to its stored typed expression before the shared
`repository/rpm_dependency/render.rs` renderer supplies lossless canonical
spelling. Exact duplicate native groups collapse. An ordinary requirement
collapses into an identical prerequisite only when every other projected fact
agrees. This follows pinned libsolv 0.7.36
[`adddep`](https://github.com/openSUSE/libsolv/blob/0.7.36/ext/repo_rpmmd.c)
and [`repo_addid_dep`](https://github.com/openSUSE/libsolv/blob/0.7.36/src/repo.c),
which unify exact dependency IDs on the prerequisite side regardless of source
order. Different versions, expressions, atoms, or metadata remain distinct;
Debian and ALPM groups retain exact comparison. Applying the same projection
before candidate resolution binds missing-dependency evidence to the native
prerequisite group hash. Persisted source catalogs and oracle schemas do not
change; no source declarations are removed or rewritten. The agreement check
uses the RPM source grammar for retained source text, so empty serialized epochs
are decoded before comparison with the strict stored expression.
After agreement, explicit zero epochs are omitted from every projected operand
and its atom index using the native producer's shared EVR spelling function.
Positive epochs and source metadata remain unchanged, including inside
conditional, alternative, and same-package expressions.

`repository/catalog/parity/rpm_provides.rs` applies the same pinned
`repo_addid_dep` ordered-set rule to source-declared RPM providers. It first
requires unique contiguous source indices, retains the first declaration only
when every fact except its index agrees, then assigns indices in the native
dependency array. Exact-identity and file-derived providers stay distinct.
Package comparison and the ephemeral resolver share this projection; the
catalog retains every original declaration and its original source index.

The same projection decodes unversioned atomic `packageand(...)` Supplements
through pinned libsolv's
[`repo_fix_supplements`](https://github.com/openSUSE/libsolv/blob/0.7.36/src/suse.c#L177-L230)
grammar. Colon-separated names form the ordered conjunction, empty fields are
skipped, and `pattern:` qualifies the following field. The native 1,024-byte
buffer boundary and no-operand case leave the literal atom unchanged, as do
versioned atoms and other relation kinds. The source atom index must agree
before its derived conjunction and atom index enter the native projection.
Exact-identity duplicates obey profile
precedence only when every projected fact agrees. A contradictory duplicate
fails the complete crawl. The private SQLite spool, canonical bundle write,
and independent complete reopen use the same bounded contract as the ALPM
producer.

Pinned libsolv also derives
`namespace:splitprovides(prefix with /path)` supplements from atomic
source-declared `prefix:/path` provides. That `REL_NAMESPACE` tree is legacy
installed-package update machinery, not an authenticated RPM `Supplements:`
record. Before excluding it from source package facts, the producer requires an
exact `namespace:splitprovides` wrapper, exact nested `REL_WITH` atoms, the
matching atomic declared capability, and same-package authenticated file
coverage. Coverage is either the exact declared path or a strict descendant
separated by `/`; lexical-prefix lookalikes and files owned only by another
package fail closed. Unknown namespaces, malformed trees or paths, and missing
source facts also fail closed.
Source-declared rich supplements remain projected through typed relation IDs and
must still agree with canonical RPM grammar.

cargo run -p conary-core --features native-rpm-oracle \
  --bin conary-rpm-oracle -- \
  --profile-manifest profile.json \
  --source-snapshot fedora-source.json \
  --primary primary.xml.gz --filelists filelists.xml.zst \
  --output rpm-oracle
```

Debian package-fact evidence is produced only with the explicit
`native-debian-oracle` feature and pinned apt-pkg 3.2.0 from the Ubuntu
26.04 image. Ordinary Conary and Remi builds do not acquire an apt-pkg
dependency. Each ordered profile member supplies one `SourceSnapshotV1` and
exactly one local object bound as `DebianPackages`. The producer copies the
compressed object to private staging, verifies its authenticated size
and SHA-256, and then independently reopens the staged bytes through apt-pkg's
compression, strict deb822, and dependency-expression APIs. It does not invoke
`apt`, `apt-get`, `dpkg`, their databases, the Conary Debian parser, a Conary
catalog, or operational repository SQLite.

Every deb822 stanza becomes one native row before profile deduplication. The
producer projects package/version/architecture and `Multi-Arch`
identity, payload location/SHA-256/size, package and declared providers,
comma-separated groups and alternatives, architecture qualifiers, required
and pre-required relations, recommends, suggests, enhances, conflicts,
breaks, and replacements. Empty, malformed, repeated-authority, or unsupported
native shapes fail the complete input. apt-pkg process globals remain behind
one ownership lock for the complete native handle lifetime. Exact-identity
duplicates use the same fact equality, precedence, bounded SQLite spool,
canonical write, and complete independent reopen contract as the ALPM and RPM
producers.

```

## Dependency resolution evidence

`NativeResolutionOracleV1` is the separate resolver-owned authority for each
exact root's complete typed resolution outcome. Its manifest binds the
`ProfileRevisionV2`, the `NativeParityOracleV1` manifest digest, the
solver implementation and version, its projection schema, the target
architecture, normalized counts, and the SHA-256 and size of `roots.jsonl`.
The resolution policy architecture must equal the bound profile revision's
typed target architecture during manifest binding, comparison, and promotion
proof validation.

Schema 3 fixes the resolution policy rather than accepting solver flags or
free-form policy: the installed state is empty, every exact package variant is
requested as its exact root, only required and pre-required groups enter the
positive solve, optional and build groups are excluded, and provider choice
uses native repository precedence. `architecture_admission: native_only`
admits only equality of the complete source-derived machine identity and the
source scheme's architecture-independent token (`noarch`, `all`, or `any`),
which resolves to the target identity for comparison. Its decision is the
closed runtime enum
`Admitted`, `Excluded { identity: NativeMachineIdentityV1 }`, or
`UnknownArchitectureToken { scheme, token }`. Only `Excluded` may produce
`not_installable { reason: architecture_excluded }`. Unknown tokens return the
typed producer error and the diagnostics-only survey records the separate
`unknown_architecture_token` error kind. This resolution-time branch is an
invariant guard because the package oracle must already have rejected the row.
`NativeMachineIdentityV1` contains only CPU, pointer width, endianness, and
32-bit ARM float ABI. The executable's libc and OS never enter it. Package ABI
is a separate typed dimension: dpkg contributes `gnu`, `musl`, or `uclibc`
from `tupletable`; RPM and ALPM contribute their profile-declared implied
glibc ABI. The profile registry owns the required target package ABI.
Native-only admission requires both package/profile-target machine equality
and package/profile ABI equality. The shared decision accepts the selected
profile and package architecture; it does not accept a host architecture. RPM
`arch_compat` and `buildarch_compat` still only establish that a token is known
and never grant native-only equality. Native solvers apply their pinned
package-manager architecture policy to provider selection, while the Conary
candidate resolver uses the same profile-bound full identities for RPM,
Debian, and Arch roots and providers. Conary and Eopkg repository candidates
remain on their explicit scheme-owned machine-matching paths because those
schemes have no typed foreign-profile architecture authority. A different
policy requires a schema change.
The three native producers and the Conary candidate producer derive the solver
architecture from the profile revision. Their `--architecture` or operator
input is only an assertion: a mismatch returns the typed
`ProfileArchitectureMismatch` error before any root is walked or output bundle
is created.

There is exactly one canonical row for every package key in the bound package
oracle. A row records exactly one outcome:

- `resolved`, with a strictly ordered duplicate-free closure of exact package
  keys that includes the root; or
- `unresolved`, with a strictly ordered duplicate-free set of requiring
  package keys and canonical required-group digests; or
- `not_installable { reason: architecture_excluded }`, when native-only policy
  excludes the exact root before Conary's SAT solver or a Debian/ALPM native
  solve is invoked, or when libsolv reports the matching exact-root
  `SOLVER_RULE_PKG_NOT_INSTALLABLE` rule; or
- `not_installable { reason: conflicting_closure }`, when the root-reachable
  required closure contains a negative or exclusive relation that prevents
  coexistence, or when an obsoletes transaction can complete only by
  displacing the exact root. This outcome deliberately carries no evidence
  set because the native solvers and Resolvo expose different evidence shapes;
  full native evidence remains diagnostics-only survey material.

Conflict-class failure dominates every other failed-state attribution. Each
producer first looks for any negative or exclusive relation anywhere in the
root-reachable failed closure. If found, including beside typed missing
requirements, it emits `conflicting_closure`. Otherwise typed missing groups
emit `unresolved` with the same exact edges as before. A failed solve with
neither class remains a fatal producer error. Issue #814 records this decision:
apt may hide a missing dependency below a conflict-rejected helper, libsolv may
split missing and conflict facts across problems, and Resolvo may minimize its
first graph to the missing edge. Missing-first precedence would therefore make
solver diagnostics, rather than package semantics, authoritative.

| Producer | Authoritative conflict-class mapping |
| --- | --- |
| libsolv | Any `PKG_CONFLICTS` (`0x105`), `PKG_SAME_NAME` (`0x106`), `PKG_OBSOLETES` (`0x107`), or implicit-obsoletes (`0x108`) rule in any failed problem; also a successful transaction that omits the exact root. Architecture-only `INFARCH` remains outside this class. |
| apt-pkg | Any rejected `Conflicts`/`Breaks` relation or mutually incompatible selected target/version in the failed state. No-satisfying-candidate required groups remain typed missing only when no conflict-class fact exists. |
| libalpm | A conflicting-dependencies or obsoletion result from transaction preparation, a prepared transaction that omits the exact root, or native `check_conflicts` results that block every libalpm-authorized provider path reached from the exact root when preparation reports missing dependencies first. A conflict on a rejected provider alternative is not part of the required closure. |
| Conary/Resolvo | A `ConflictEdge::Conflict` or `ConflictNode::Excluded` that remains on every viable exact-root provider path. Missing-first probing discharges exact persisted groups under one per-root budget: at most 64 re-solves and 30 seconds on a monotonic clock, including the probe's initial provider load. Loaded facts are reused across fresh SAT caches; limits never reset per iteration. Exhaustion is `HiddenConflictProbeBudgetExceeded { root, resolves, elapsed }` before classification, never an outcome. |

Stored native and candidate resolution manifests are inspected before parsing
current nested fields. `NativeResolutionBundleState::ObsoleteSchema { found,
current }` classifies schemas 1 and 2 as non-authority requiring regeneration;
schema 3 is current. Zero, future schemas, missing/duplicate/non-integer schema
fields, and malformed current manifests remain invalid input. The shared strict
reader returns `Error::ResolutionBundleRebuildRequired { found, current }` for
obsolete bundles. Promotion proof/evidence preserve that type through context;
the Remi CLI reports `resolution_bundle_rebuild_required`. Lane production,
assembly, and survey transport also fence retired resolution bundles before
nested validation (Python tools emit typed obsolete/rebuild JSON and exit 3).
No schema number changes in this fix, and no compatibility reader is introduced.

The writer and reader retain one root outcome at a time. Complete reopen uses
a private disk-backed membership index to prove that every closure reference,
requiring package, and unresolved required group exists in the exact package
oracle; root completeness is a separate bounded merge walk. Unknown fields,
mixed or empty outcomes, reordered or duplicate roots/references, count drift,
noncanonical bytes, tamper, extra bundle entries, symlinks, and package-oracle
drift fail closed.

Comparison applies the same profile, package oracle, architecture, and
typed policy to native and Conary evidence. It merge-walks one root pair at a
time and reports typed oracle-only root, candidate-only root, outcome,
dependency-closure, unresolved-dependency, or not-installable-reason drift.
Because `conflicting_closure` carries no evidence set, comparison checks only
the outcome kind and exact not-installable reason for that outcome.
Diagnostic strings and native solver error prose never establish the result.

This schema is a hard cut. Resolution-oracle schemas through 2, RPM projection
schemas through 4, Conary candidate, Debian, and ALPM projection schemas through
2, and comparison schemas through 2 have no compatibility readers. Every
retained native-resolution, Conary candidate, and resolution-comparison bundle
is invalid and must be regenerated before comparison or promotion proof. The
package oracle is unchanged. Native diagnostics surveys move to schema 3 so
conflict-class outcomes can retain their solver-native evidence without
reclassifying those roots as failures; older retained surveys are invalid.
Candidate-resolution surveys move to schema 2 and resolution-comparison
surveys move to schema 2 because both embed the expanded outcome vocabulary;
their schema-1 artifacts are invalid and have no compatibility reader.
The top-level Remi promotion-evidence envelope moves to schema 2 because it
embeds resolution-comparison schema 3. Schema-1 promotion evidence is obsolete
non-authority and must be rebuilt before promotion or activation.

### Diagnostics-only resolution survey

The three native resolution binaries also accept `--survey <FILE>`. At least
one of `--output <DIRECTORY>` and `--survey <FILE>` is required; both are
permitted and the production lane passes both for one combined walk. Survey mode
walks every package-oracle root even when a native result cannot be
projected into the strict resolution contract. It writes one create-only
canonical `NativeResolutionSurveyV1` JSON file, refuses to replace an existing
path, and exits non-zero after writing when any root failed so unattended
diagnostics cannot look successful.

`NativeResolutionSurveyV1` schema 3 binds the profile identity and revision
digest, package-oracle manifest digest, native implementation and projection
schema, fixed resolution policy, and target architecture. Its counts record
roots walked, resolved, unresolved, not-installable, and failed plus a canonical histogram
keyed by the originating typed Conary `Error` variant and a stable short
reason. Each retained failure records the root package key,
name/version/release/architecture, full sanitized error message, and typed
native explanation. The inventory retains at most 5,000 failure records while
reporting the uncapped `total_failures`, retained count, limit, and explicit
`truncated` state.

`diagnostic_outcomes` separately retains at most 5,000
`conflicting_closure` roots with their exact typed outcome and byte-bounded
native explanation. The survey reports the uncapped total, retained count,
record limit, and explicit truncation state. These records are successful
outcomes, contribute to `not_installable_roots`, and never contribute to
failure counts or the error histogram. No other successful outcome carries
survey evidence. The explanation budget is shared with retained failure
evidence and changes to explicit `withheld` records once exhausted. Retained
explanations are capped at 32 MiB, reserving half of the lane's 64 MiB complete
survey-document limit for root records and the canonical envelope. Rust
validation and the lane reader both reject a document above that complete-file
limit.

The lane's sanitized survey manifest projects the already-validated
`evidence_byte_limit` from the native survey into its `survey` summary; the
protected workflow requires exactly 33,554,432 bytes in both documents.
Omitting that summary field is invalid schema-3 output, not a new schema or a
reason to weaken the workflow check. No persisted contract changes here;
incomplete retained summaries must be regenerated from the validated survey.
The lane regression suite executes the protected workflow's exact survey
validation step against producer-generated fixtures for all three ecosystems,
including negative manifest and rebound-digest count mutations. The release
matrix suite runs that proof and rejects removal of either the writer's budget
projection or the workflow's budget check. This keeps producer-versus-operator
drift in the pull-request gate without maintaining a copied test predicate.

The survey contract and writer live in
`crates/conary-core/src/repository/catalog/parity/resolution_survey.rs`;
their retention, hard-cut validation, and private-writer regressions live in the
sibling `resolution_survey/tests.rs`.

RPM explanations preserve every libsolv problem and every rule in that
problem, including numeric and symbolic `SOLVER_RULE_*` type, native index,
from/to package key plus name-EVR-architecture, dependency ID, and dependency
text. A resolved transaction that displaces its exact root instead preserves a
typed `resolved` result and the complete native transaction package list,
including an empty list. Native-only provider admission removed the strict-priority multilib
problem shape, so there is no residual solve without strict priority.
Conflict-class rules become ordinary `conflicting_closure` outcomes while
architecture-only `INFARCH` remains outside that class. Any native field that
cannot safely be projected carries an explicit unavailability reason. Debian
explanations retain selected native package identities, conflict-class state,
or typed missing requirements when apt-pkg returns them; an
apt-pkg failure that exposes no typed result says so. ALPM explanations retain
prepared package identities, typed missing requirements, and package-conflict
records. The pinned Rust ALPM binding cannot safely dereference its
invalid-architecture detail list, so that typed result records the detail as
unavailable rather than inventing or unsafely reading it.

Survey collection and strict writing share the same per-root resolution path.
libsolv clears the previous solver/transaction before each solve, apt-pkg
clears result storage and constructs fresh dependency caches per root, and
libalpm releases every transaction before the next root. A failed root
therefore cannot contaminate a later solve.

Every strict and survey root walk is parallel behind one bounded,
sequence-numbered sink. Input dispatch follows package-oracle order and only
the parent/calling thread updates writers, collectors, histograms, record caps,
or the 32 MiB explanation budget. The next sequence goes to the first available
worker, so an uneven solve cannot strand idle capacity behind a busy worker's
private queue. Results may finish out of order, but the sink does not observe
root `n + 1` before root `n`; strict mode stops dispatch after the first failing
canonical root, drains workers, and returns that failure. Combined mode discards
the strict writer on failure and continues collecting the complete survey.
Consequently worker scheduling cannot change `roots.jsonl`, manifest bytes or
digests, survey JSON, counts, histograms, caps, or budget decisions.
The sink publishes independent conflict-outcome and fatal-failure explanation
allowances to workers. Reaching the 5,000 conflict-record cap suppresses later
conflict explanation construction without consuming or hiding evidence still
available to a later retained fatal failure.

RPM and ALPM use threads with a private libsolv pool or libalpm handle and a
private read-only SQLite index connection per worker. Conary workers likewise
open one read-only SQLite connection apiece and construct fresh resolvo state
per root. apt-pkg configuration and system pointers are process-global, so the
Debian lane uses child processes; each builds its own cache and solver from the
same staged authenticated `Packages` inputs. No native handle crosses a thread
or process boundary.

Each Debian worker indexes authenticated source records and native cache
versions once by exact name, version text, and architecture. Source lookup
preserves the first record in authenticated member order; duplicate native
identities retain an ambiguity marker that fails only when that exact root is
requested. Ordered-map lookup uses logarithmic identity comparisons instead of
scanning every source or native package for each root and closure member, with
linear index storage per worker. Index ordering never selects a preferred
version: apt-pkg policy and its solver retain that authority. These private
indexes do not change native projection schemas or canonical oracle bytes.

`--workers <positive-integer>` is a typed input on all three native resolution
binaries and on `remi resolution-survey`. Omission selects the minimum of
`available_parallelism()`, the cgroup-v2 CPU quota, root count, and memory
capacity. Memory capacity subtracts `memory.current` from every bounded
cgroup-v2 ancestor (or uses host `MemAvailable`), reserves 25% of that remaining
capacity, caps the worker-pool budget at 8 GiB, and divides it by the retained
Fedora single-pool allowance of 1.5 GiB (rounded above the measured 1,271,280
KiB one-worker root-walk RSS observation). Native binaries require a separate
`--implementation-evidence <FILE>` destination. Its create-only schema-1 JSON
records the selected worker count, every worker's pool/cache load milliseconds,
the effective memory budget, and the measured allowance; those run-dependent
facts never enter canonical oracle or survey bytes. Combined production binds
the same implementation evidence into both the survey manifest and strict lane
evidence, with no schema or binding changes.

The three native producer binaries enable info-level tracing to stderr. Each
walk emits a typed `start` event with `workers`, `cpu_limit`,
`memory_budget_bytes`, and `root_count`; `progress` events report `roots_walked`,
`total`, and `elapsed_ms` every 5,000 roots or 60 seconds since the previous
report, whichever comes first. A heartbeat continues during worker loading or
a long-running root. A `finish` event reports the final count and duration,
including a walk that returns an error. Progress never writes to stdout or
changes persisted evidence schemas, so failed lanes retain worker-sizing and
progress evidence in their job logs.

The retained Fedora measurement covered all 101,187 roots and used
profile-manifest SHA-256
`9004072f1fc9b1b932616a4b8b33a2277241c481734670f4172aa378433ba084`.
Both passes used release binary SHA-256
`407485a67107802a670561db60b4fbcb3cc2f05a11c6b0baef58bbdd4e387198`
from commit `23f702c3` inside `conary-oracle-fedora-slice6`. The observed 12 CPUs
and 8 GiB worker budget made five workers the automatic capacity.

| Workers | Wall seconds | User seconds | System seconds | Peak RSS KiB | Per-worker pool load ms |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | :--- |
| 1 | 10,832.801 | 3,231.511 | 184.536 | 1,656,556 | 26,540 |
| 5 | 6,774.840 | 3,458.632 | 192.119 | 3,801,984 | 31,460; 31,540; 31,676; 31,479; 31,519 |

The five-worker end-to-end speedup was 1.60x. Both runs recorded the same 45
typed failures and produced byte-identical 167,998-byte survey JSON with
SHA-256
`0fd754eed04d6cd9bfa5e7a58d392b1eec4c9b3bf4b31b91805e833c3826874c`.
The mandatory authenticated package-oracle reprojection was storage-bound and
varied between the sequential runs, so wall time is retained with CPU, RSS,
and pool-load evidence rather than treated as an isolated solver benchmark.

Survey JSON is a diagnostics aid only. It never creates `manifest.json` or
`roots.jsonl`, is not a `NativeResolutionOracleV1` bundle, and has no parity,
comparison, promotion-proof, activation, or publication authority. Promotion
continues to require the strict bundle and complete independent reopen. Survey
records contain package identities and native solver evidence only; private
paths, credentials, tokens, environment data, and host details are forbidden.

For any ecosystem, use the same authenticated inputs as strict production and
replace the output destination, for example:

```bash
cargo run -p conary-core --features native-rpm-oracle \
  --bin conary-rpm-resolution-oracle -- \
  --profile-manifest profile.json \
  --source-snapshot fedora-source.json \
  --primary primary.xml.gz --filelists filelists.xml.zst \
  --package-oracle rpm-oracle \
  --architecture x86_64 \
  --workers 4 \
  --implementation-evidence rpm-resolution-implementation.json \
  --survey rpm-resolution-survey.json
```

The Debian and ALPM binaries use the same `--survey <FILE>` alternative with
their existing `--packages` and `--database` member inputs respectively.

### Candidate-resolution and comparison surveys

`ConaryResolutionSurveyV1` schema 2 is the diagnostics-only Conary counterpart
to the native survey. It binds the profile revision, package-oracle
manifest, `conary-sat` implementation and projection schema, native-only
policy, and the profile's typed target architecture. The policy architecture,
operator assertion, and profile target must agree before output creation. The
producer walks every package-oracle key through the same per-root code as
strict candidate production. Every successful root retains its
name/version/release/architecture/key and one complete `resolved`,
`unresolved`, or `not_installable` outcome. A failed root contributes to
uncapped counts and a canonical histogram keyed by typed Conary error variant
and stable producer reason; up to 5,000 failures retain the same root
identity, full error message, and native explanation.

Candidate native explanations are projected directly from resolvo's typed
`ConflictGraph`, `ConflictNode`, `ConflictEdge`, and `ConflictCause` values.
They retain unresolved-node incoming edges with the requiring solvable and
rendered requirement/version sets, conflict edges with both solvable
identities and typed conflict kind, and excluded solvables with their typed
provider reason. No `display_user_friendly` text is parsed. Explanations share
the native survey's canonical-JSON accounting, 32 MiB explanation budget,
failure-record cap, first-exhaustion withholding rule, and independently
validated count/truncation invariants. They are built only on a hard per-root
failure.

`NativeResolutionComparisonSurveyV1` schema 2 first reopens two complete,
package-oracle-bound resolution bundles, then walks every root pair in
canonical key order. Every retained mismatch records the root identity,
typed mismatch kind, both complete outcomes, and the manifest SHA-256 that
identifies each side's evidence. It retains at most 5,000 mismatch records
while preserving uncapped totals, a canonical histogram by mismatch kind, a
canonical histogram by native/candidate outcome-kind pair, and explicit
truncation. Strict comparison still aborts on its first mismatch.

`remi resolution-survey` owns both surveys under the normal exclusive
stopped-runtime lock and mirrors `promotion-prove`'s ordered private bindings:

```text
remi resolution-survey \
  --config /etc/conary/remi.toml \
  --candidate fedora-44=<profile-revision-sha256> \
  --candidate ubuntu-26.04=<profile-revision-sha256> \
  --candidate arch=<profile-revision-sha256> \
  --package-oracle fedora-44=<directory> \
  --package-oracle ubuntu-26.04=<directory> \
  --package-oracle arch=<directory> \
  --native-resolution fedora-44=<directory> \
  --native-resolution ubuntu-26.04=<directory> \
  --native-resolution arch=<directory> \
  --architecture fedora-44=x86_64 \
  --architecture ubuntu-26.04=amd64 \
  --architecture arch=x86_64 \
  --workers 4 \
  --output-dir <new-private-survey-directory>
```

The output directory is create-only and mode `0700` on Unix; each canonical
survey file is create-only and mode `0600`. Per-profile candidate and
comparison implementation JSON files record the selected workers and their
load times separately from those canonical surveys. A profile with candidate failures
cannot produce a complete candidate bundle, so its comparison survey is
skipped while later profiles are still surveyed. Complete candidates are
materialized only below an automatically removed temporary directory. The
command reports all written findings and returns Remi's top-level failure status
`101` when any candidate failure or comparison mismatch exists.

Survey root identities preserve the package oracle's complete native `version`
and separate catalog `package_release` (rendered as `release` in survey JSON).
RPM, Debian, and ALPM producers retain the native release/revision in `version`
and emit an empty separate release. Candidate outcomes, retained failures,
comparison mismatches, and the independent transport verifier accept that exact
empty-string representation; present releases retain their existing printable
ASCII, length, and whitespace bounds. No release is synthesized or split from
`version`, and authenticated package-key and identity comparisons remain exact.
The existing wire schemas and persisted representation are unchanged.

Neither survey is evidence authority. Their JSON cannot be opened as a strict
resolution bundle or `NativeResolutionComparisonV1`; promotion proof,
activation, publication, and every binding/validation path reject it. Survey
files also carry no private paths, credentials, environment data, or host
identity.

The protected production consumer is `.github/workflows/survey-remi-resolution.yml`.
Its single `oracle_run_id` selects one successful three-lane
`produce-remi-native-oracles` run. The workflow authenticates that run's
head as its own exact current protected-main operator commit, then authenticates
the assembled three-lane artifact and derives and reopens the exact export and
deployment runs, then verifies the API metadata, successful producer job, and
archive digest for each referenced strict lane. Retained same-export lanes from
earlier successful runs remain valid only through those bindings. It
authenticates the lane files into one manifest-bound transport and requires the
export's typed operator attestation to bind that run's exact workflow commit to
the protected pinned-host-key SSH contract.
Pre-attestation exports are non-authority. The survey workflow requires the
helper from its exact protected `github.workflow_sha` to be byte-identical to
the helper at its freshly fetched protected `origin/main` and requires the
complete workflow revision to equal that exact current-main commit. It stages
the helper, refetches protected main, repeats both equalities immediately before the existing
`install-helper` action. The root helper independently resolves protected main
through GitHub's HTTPS API, fetches that exact commit's helper, matches its
digest, and installs those root-fetched bytes rather than caller-staged code.
The workflow then calls the three-argument
`conary-remi-deploy survey-resolution` action with the survey identity, export
identity, and typed oracle transport path. The root-owned helper reads the exact
candidate revisions from the stopped deployment's own pointers, uses the
profile-bound architectures, and freezes the survey JSON under root ownership
before restarting. Cleanup owns every exit from the instant root staging is
created, and deployment-inspection and survey stderr remain in one mode-`0600`
staging diagnostic that is never transported or logged. It accepts status `101`
only when the typed outcome records
at least one finding, polls `/health/ready` to a bounded successful result
regardless of those findings, and returns only survey JSON
and separate resolution-walk implementation JSON plus a digest, size,
deployment, candidate, and oracle binding manifest. Survey transport manifest
and verification evidence schema 3 bind every candidate/comparison survey to
its implementation file; the independent reader validates the worker count,
per-worker load-time vector, effective memory budget, and retained worker RSS
allowance. The input transport manifest and input verification evidence both
use schema 2. Recovery exports take the survey ID, export ID, and authenticated
input-manifest SHA-256. Retained input-manifest bytes must match that digest
before the helper's shared input validator checks schema 2, canonical JSON,
identities, profiles, deployment, workflow runs, and declared members. The
runner repeats the same digest-first validation before publishing recovery
as `input_binding: verified`; mismatched bytes fail as
`input_manifest.digest_mismatch`, and schema failures retain the shared
validator's typed reason. The input manifest bypasses the diagnostic recovery
schema. The helper owns one per-key recovery schema for envelope and detailed
survey fields; the runner invokes it directly. It checks scalar types, enums,
object fields, and array element types, including empty containers. Unknown
fields and values outside their declared types are private; sanitization replaces
them with typed redaction tokens, and raw recovery members with these defects are
withheld with `unknown_key` or `type_mismatch`. Path and URI checks remain defense
in depth. Detailed candidate/comparison diagnostics use streaming redaction of
private package identities and error text, preserving public counts, digests,
policy enums, and implementation measurements. The export hashes the sanitized
bytes and rechecks them before archiving; frozen source bytes remain unchanged.
Actual helper-produced survey documents and Rust outcome fixtures exercise this
shared policy in both the shell and Python suites. Missing retained input remains `not_retained`; an included
manifest cannot claim binding through a withheld entry.

These are #814 hard cuts: input envelopes move from 1 to 2 and
output envelopes from 2 to 3. Readers classify retired envelopes before nested
validation as typed `obsolete` / `schema_rebuild_required` non-authority with
the found/current schemas and a rebuild message (the Python CLI exits 3).
A current envelope containing mismatched nested schemas remains invalid input.
All retained survey inputs and outputs must be regenerated; this envelope cut
does not change or invalidate the current package or resolution oracle bundles.
The
workflow independently reopens that transport, enforces the complete typed Rust
survey schemas and their cross-count, retention, evidence-budget, and mismatch
relationships, including the fixed 5,000-record, 32-MiB retained-evidence, and
64-MiB native survey-document limits. It
binds candidate implementation to the profile ecosystem, `conary-sat`, and
projection schema 3. Comparison counts must cover the exact complete
zero-failure candidate root population, and every retained mismatch root,
identity, and candidate outcome must come from that candidate survey. It then
compares every authority binding with its authenticated input verification, and
its seven-day artifact
also retains the authenticated three-lane assembly. Neither helper input
admission nor runner output verification imposes an aggregate transport limit
absent from the producer contract. The uncompressed input archive uses GNU
base-256 tar headers to avoid USTAR's unsupported 8-GiB per-member ceiling
without admitting PAX metadata. The runner chunk-copies and authenticates each
declared member into private mode-`0700` staging, maps those files read-only,
and decodes large root-record arrays one canonical record at a time.
Its comparison join keeps only the fixed retained-mismatch envelope rather
than indexing the complete candidate population. Remi returns bounded
per-profile summaries to the helper, including the comparison candidate
manifest digest, so transport construction never reparses a whole survey with
`jq`. The workflow reader reconstructs the exact strict candidate root stream
and manifest from streamed outcomes and the authenticated package manifest,
and it requires those zero-failure roots and identities to cover the mapped
authenticated package rows exactly. Nested closure and dependency vectors are
streamed element by element, and copied survey files are discarded after each
profile; the comparison digest must match even for zero mismatches. All
profiles bind their total and retained root identities to the package
stream before the findings branch. Zero-failure profiles additionally replay
the authenticated native root stream against candidate outcomes and recompute
the comparison totals, ordered histograms, and retained evidence.
Aggregate and per-profile summary counts retain exact JSON integer types. The
helper archives the frozen root-owned survey files directly after service
restoration, so transport construction does not allocate another survey-sized
staging copy. Authenticated oracle members are materialized in private
root-owned staging on the `/conary/evidence` capacity domain, leaving `/tmp`
to hold only the caller-owned ingress transport and sanitized egress archive.
Runner assembly removes each authenticated artifact ZIP after extraction and
consumes each extracted lane member after writing it to the transport, avoiding
a three-copy unbounded full-catalog working set.
Raw deployment-inspection
and survey stderr remain confined to
mode-`0600` root-controlled helper staging, are destroyed during helper cleanup,
and are never emitted through SSH or
workflow logs; public failures contain only a typed helper message. Neither side
has promotion, activation, or publication authority.
An older workflow rerun fails before root mutation even when helper bytes are
unchanged, and any protected-main advance during input processing fences the
run. Stale verifier code therefore cannot certify evidence or leave the root
entry point downgraded.

ALPM resolution evidence is produced by the same explicit
`native-alpm-oracle` feature and pinned libalpm runtime as the package-fact
oracle. The resolver helper independently reopens the supplied package bundle,
then reproduces that entire package oracle from the authenticated database
objects and requires exact manifest equality before solving. For each exact
package row, it prepares a database-only libalpm transaction against an empty
local database with the target architecture and profile databases registered
in precedence order. Prepared transaction packages become exact closure keys;
typed libalpm missing-dependency records become exact requiring-package keys
and canonical required-group digests. A non-native exact root becomes the
typed architecture-excluded outcome before transaction setup. A conflicting
dependency, obsoletion result, or prepared transaction that omits the exact
root becomes `conflicting_closure`; missing dependencies become `unresolved`
only when no conflict class exists. When preparation exposes missing first, the
producer follows required dependencies depth-first in native dependency order,
using `alpm_find_dbs_satisfier` (the same `resolvedep` implementation as native
preparation), and checks that single default closure with libalpm. Satisfaction
by already selected packages is also a native query. A satisfying literal is
selected in registered database order; shadowed literals are never alternatives.

Provider alternatives are considered only for dependencies whose selected
provider's required closure **reaches** a party on either side of the reported
conflict, including a transitively introduced party. After native conflict
preparation, this is a graph walk over `alpm_trans_get_add()` plus the exact
root. Each edge binds a required dependency to a satisfier within that chosen
set using libalpm's own selected-package precedence (`alpm_find_satisfier`);
unselected sync-database providers cannot change the graph. Relevance is read
from each failed transaction before the next retry releases it. When preparation
fails early with missing dependencies, before the native add set is populated, the
fallback walks the selected provider's sync-database dependency closure with
native database-precedence selection. This fallback requires an actually
unpopulated add set (empty or containing only the root); a later missing result
with a populated add set still uses the native chosen graph. Neither walk explores
alternatives or adds transaction/conflict evaluations; retries remain inside the
existing per-root check budget. Parties are bound by their native source database,
name, and version, since libalpm copies package objects into conflict records. In native
`ALPM_QUESTION_SELECT_PROVIDER` question order, the producer walks a stack of
provider choices depth-first. It re-prepares the exact root with the stack's
ancestor answers and one alternative for the current question, leaving unrelated
dependencies at their native defaults. Only providers offered by that native
question are eligible. A candidate is accepted only after native preparation
and, for missing-first results, the native answer-replayed closure conflict check
report no conflict. Every dependency lookup explicitly installs the same provider
callback as preparation and replays all active answers, including nested choices;
database precedence and eligible alternatives remain native authority.
Successful preparation produces `resolved`. A conflict-free missing result is
retained while remaining alternatives are checked: any prepared path wins;
otherwise the first conflict-free missing result in depth-first native
question/provider order becomes `unresolved`. Its original typed missing edges
and exact selected-package bindings are saved together, so later transactions
cannot replace or rebind that deterministic fallback. Budget exhaustion still
fails before choosing any fallback. If a retry still conflicts,
its own chosen set and reported parties determine relevance again. Relevant
questions not yet explored on the current path are pushed onto the stack and
their alternatives explored before backtracking to the previous question's next
provider. Visibility alone never marks a question explored: a question seen but
irrelevant in an ancestor failure remains searchable when a descendant failure
first makes it relevant. The explored set is derived only from active stack
answers that have actually been probed; an ancestor's question is not pushed
again on that path. Backtracking discards the exhausted frame's answer and
exploration state, so the question can be explored independently in a sibling
branch if relevant there. Unrelated choices remain at native defaults rather
than being combined into a global Cartesian product.
The shim only replays native questions and reads native
transaction state; libalpm performs every resolution and conflict decision.

`PROVIDER_SEARCH_CHECK_LIMIT: u32 = 256` bounds each exact root's actual native
evaluations: every `trans_prepare` and each additional missing-first
`check_conflicts` consumes one check. Dependency/satisfier queries are not
transaction/conflict evaluations. Before evaluation 257 the producer returns
typed `ProviderSearchBudgetExceeded { root, checks: 256 }`. All stack depths share
that budget, and exhaustion propagates before closure classification, never as
a fallback to the baseline conflict. Only an exhausted question stack with all
required checks completed can retain the baseline `conflicting_closure`.
Strict production fails without publishing a complete bundle. Survey production
records `provider_search_budget_exceeded` as the
failure reason and error variant, with the exact root and completed check count
in typed ALPM failure evidence, and continues to later roots. The budget and
provider-answer callback are reset for each root. This is part of #814's
current resolution/survey hard cut; the package oracle is unchanged.

Ambiguous identities, unbound requirements,
and unexpected native error classes fail the complete crawl. The public Arch profile's three
authenticated database inputs are all `/os/x86_64`; their package rows are
`x86_64` or architecture-independent `any` under the pinned lane.

Invoke the resolver helper with the exact package bundle produced above:

```bash
cargo run -p conary-core --features native-alpm-oracle \
  --bin conary-alpm-resolution-oracle -- \
  --profile-manifest profile.json \
  --source-snapshot core-source.json --database core.db \
  --source-snapshot extra-source.json --database extra.db \
  --source-snapshot multilib-source.json --database multilib.db \
  --package-oracle alpm-oracle \
  --architecture x86_64 \
  --implementation-evidence alpm-resolution-implementation.json \
  --output alpm-resolution-oracle
```

Success means every exact package-oracle row has one canonical outcome and the
two-file resolution bundle has been durably written, reopened, and fully
cross-checked against that exact package oracle.

RPM resolution evidence is produced by the same explicit
`native-rpm-oracle` feature and exact libsolv 0.7.36 runtime as the RPM
package-fact oracle. The resolver independently reopens the supplied package
bundle, freshly reproduces its entire manifest from the authenticated primary
and filelists objects, and loads those objects again into a target-architecture
solver pool. Profile member precedence becomes native repository priority;
distinct versions remain native candidates, while exact duplicate identities
retain the already-proved higher-precedence provenance.

After `pool_setarch`, the shim calls libsolv 0.7.36
`pool_setarchpolicy(pool, architecture)` with the single native architecture.
Pinned `poolarch.c` initializes `noarch` as installable independently of that
policy string. Cross-machine solvables remain inspectable exact roots but are
not installable and are absent from the prepared provider index.

Every package-oracle key binds through a private disk-backed index to one exact
native solvable root. Weak relations are disabled. Successful transaction IDs
become exact closure package keys. Typed libsolv problem-rule and dependency
IDs become exact requiring-package keys and canonical required or pre-required
group digests. An excluded exact root must carry libsolv's matching
`SOLVER_RULE_PKG_NOT_INSTALLABLE` and becomes the typed architecture-excluded
outcome; the same rule for an admitted root is fatal. A typed missing file
requirement triggers an exact lookup in libsolv's independently reopened
complete filelists and one re-solve before it may remain unresolved. Any
`PKG_CONFLICTS`, `PKG_SAME_NAME`, `PKG_OBSOLETES`, or implicit-obsoletes rule
in any failed problem, and any successful transaction that omits its exact
root, becomes `conflicting_closure` before missing requirements are considered.
Architecture-only `SOLVER_RULE_INFARCH`, unexpected rule classes, native
identity ambiguity, and input or oracle drift fail the complete crawl.
Diagnostic strings never establish an outcome.

Invoke the resolver helper with the exact RPM package bundle produced above:

```bash
cargo run -p conary-core --features native-rpm-oracle \
  --bin conary-rpm-resolution-oracle -- \
  --profile-manifest profile.json \
  --source-snapshot fedora-source.json \
  --primary primary.xml.gz --filelists filelists.xml.zst \
  --package-oracle rpm-oracle \
  --architecture x86_64 \
  --implementation-evidence rpm-resolution-implementation.json \
  --output rpm-resolution-oracle
```

Success has the same complete per-root and independent reopen meaning as the
ALPM producer. Neither native helper reads Conary catalog rows or invokes a
source package manager executable.

Debian resolution evidence is produced by the same explicit
`native-debian-oracle` feature and exact apt-pkg 3.2.0 runtime as the Debian
package-fact oracle. The resolver independently reopens the supplied package
bundle, freshly reproduces its entire manifest from the authenticated
`Packages` objects, and loads private volatile apt-pkg source indexes for the
target architecture. It uses an empty status file and never reads an installed
package database.

Profile member order is projected into apt-pkg candidate policy and native
provider priority. Every exact package-oracle key binds through a private
disk-backed index to one exact native package version and becomes a root.
The pinned apt 3.0 dependency solver receives that exact root as a protected
forced version and runs with non-strict pinning against the complete
authenticated version universe. Native policy still orders dependency choices,
so the highest-precedence candidate is selected whenever it permits a complete
transaction; a lower authenticated version remains eligible only when the
forced exact root cannot close with the candidate.
Required and pre-required groups participate in resolution; weak groups do
not. Successful native transactions become exact closure package keys. When
the complete solver fails, the producer inspects every selected broken package
in apt-pkg's root-reachable post-solver dependency state. A rejected
`Conflicts` or `Breaks` relation, or a selected version that cannot coexist
with its required target, becomes `conflicting_closure`. Only when no such
state exists does a required or pre-required group with no authenticated
satisfying candidate become typed missing evidence. This covers pure missing
chains, absent target names, and names available only at incompatible versions.
Each `AptMissingRequirement` carries the exact requiring-package identity,
relation kind, and parser-owned native dependency text; the Rust boundary binds
that text to the exact package-oracle group recorded by the same Debian parser,
without textual normalization.

A failed apt marker may retain only one party of a transitive sibling conflict.
The reachable-version fallback therefore reads apt's `Conflicts`/`Breaks`
relations between every reachable pair in both directions, using native
`AllTargets` matching, and seeds the required-group fixed point with those
pairs rather than only relations against the exact root. The existing
all-candidates-blocked propagation retains usable OR alternatives.

Pinned apt-pkg 3.2.0 does not expose solver3's typed failure reason graph as a
public API: solver state, work, trail, and clause registration are protected or
private, `DependencySolver` is final, and its exported reason interface renders
strings. Diagnostic text is not parsed into authority. A failure with neither
root-reachable conflict-class state nor typed no-candidate requirements remains
a fatal native solver classification. Solver timeout attribution uses a steady
monotonic duration and always remains a fatal `NativeSolverFailed` survey
record. A policy-excluded exact root becomes the typed
architecture-excluded outcome before apt-pkg resolution. The
Ubuntu 26.04 profile supplies only sixteen `binary-amd64` indexes; apt-pkg is
likewise configured with only `APT::Architecture(s)=amd64`, while
`Architecture: all` remains admitted.
Native identity ambiguity, unsupported profile cardinality, and input or
package-oracle drift fail the complete crawl. Diagnostic strings never
establish an outcome.

Invoke the resolver helper with the exact Debian package bundle produced
above:

```bash
cargo run -p conary-core --features native-debian-oracle \
  --bin conary-debian-resolution-oracle -- \
  --profile-manifest profile.json \
  --source-snapshot ubuntu-main-source.json --packages main-Packages.xz \
  --source-snapshot ubuntu-updates-source.json --packages updates-Packages.xz \
  --package-oracle debian-oracle \
  --architecture amd64 \
  --implementation-evidence debian-resolution-implementation.json \
  --output debian-resolution-oracle
```

Success has the same complete per-root and independent reopen meaning as the
ALPM and RPM producers. The helper invokes no `apt`, `apt-get`, or `dpkg`
executable and reads neither their databases nor Conary catalog rows.

## Conary candidate resolution evidence

`produce_conary_resolution_candidate` is the candidate-side owner. It first
independently reopens the exact package and native-resolution oracle bundles,
requires the verified profile catalog to match every package-oracle fact, and
requires the native oracle to use schema 3's exact target policy. It cannot
resolve an unproved catalog or silently substitute another architecture.

The producer replays the catalog into a private temporary current-schema
resolver database. Two private mapping tables retain exact catalog package
keys and canonical requirement-group digests beside their temporary persisted
IDs. This database is evidence-generation machinery, never package or
publication authority. Every package-oracle key becomes an exact persisted-ID
root constraint, so another version, release, architecture, or repository
variant cannot stand in for it. The existing typed Conary SAT provider owns
native version, architecture, provider, Boolean grouped-requirement, and
negative-relation semantics. Optional and build groups remain outside the
positive solve.

Before constructing an exact SAT root, the producer applies the bound
native-only rule to that package through `PackageSelector`. An excluded root is
written as `architecture_excluded`, so the SAT invariant error for an exact
root with no eligible candidate remains unreachable on that path. The SAT
provider then applies repository-row admission once when each name-,
canonical-, declared-capability-, file-, soname-, AppStream-, or exact-root-
discovered row would become a solvable. A rejected provider never receives a
solver ID or enters a provider index; an unknown token is a typed load error.
An admitted root whose only provider is excluded therefore retains the
ordinary typed unresolved required edge. Debian Multi-Arch dependency
qualifiers remain match-time semantics over already-admitted solvables.

Successful SAT selections map back to a strictly ordered set of catalog
package keys. An unsatisfiable dependency maps Resolvo's typed conflict graph
back to the exact persisted required or pre-required group; diagnostic text is
never parsed. Conflict or excluded nodes are checked first and map to
`conflicting_closure`. For a minimized missing-first graph, the bounded typed
probe described above discharges only its exact persisted missing groups and
re-solves to enforce conflict dominance. `resolver/sat/hidden_conflict.rs` owns
the shared attempt/deadline budget, checked before rebuilding a SAT cache and
before accepting a result; Resolvo's cancellation callback observes the same
deadline during solving. The provider is loaded once for the probe (in addition
to the original exact-root load), and only compiled positive requirements are
discharged between attempts. A conflict-free completion retains all discovered
typed missing groups. Surveys retain exhaustion as a `budget` / `solver_failed`
failure with the root, re-solve count, and elapsed duration in its diagnostic,
using the existing failure contract; strict production propagates the concrete
typed error. No persisted schema changes. A missing mapping, an untyped
unsatisfiable result, or any selected identity outside the catalog remains a
hard crawl failure.

The producer writes one complete `NativeResolutionOracleV1` bundle using the
`conary-sat` implementation identity and projection schema 3, durably closes
it, independently reopens and cross-checks every package and group reference,
and compares it with the pinned native bundle. Success therefore proves one
canonical outcome for every exact catalog variant and returns the exact
candidate/native comparison record. A closure, unresolved-set, policy, root,
package-fact, or binding mismatch fails closed.

## Separate Slice 6 owners

ALPM, RPM, and Debian own independent pinned native evidence. Conary owns the
complete candidate crawl, durable reopen, and exact comparison. Initial
conversion crawling, exact proof reuse, independent CCS reopen, and target
preflight remain separate evidence owners. `RemiPromotionEvidenceV1`
independently reopens their artifacts, recomputes both parity comparisons, and
binds them with the complete crawl and canonical-map validation to the same
exact ordered public candidate set. The promotion owner consumes that evidence,
reopens exact proof-bound CCS bytes and every referenced durable CAS object,
publishes and reopens the signed universe bundle, and changes every selected
profile pointer plus the universe pointer in one transaction. Evidence-free
publication is limited to exact-active-authority metadata renewal.
