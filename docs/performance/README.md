# Performance evidence

This directory holds reproducible, commit-bound performance evidence for
Conary's user-facing and service workflows. Evidence records name the exact
source commit, hardware label, source identity, cache state, work performed,
and phase timings so later comparisons do not turn a changed fixture or a warm
cache into an apparent improvement.

## Exact command recorder

`apps/conary/tests/fixtures/native/record-command-performance.py` executes one
exact argv without a shell and writes one create-only schema-1 JSON record. It
binds the result to the full product and harness source commits, fixture and
prepared-environment SHA-256 digests, implementation and version, operation,
cache state, sample number, resolved executable path, and executable SHA-256.
Linux child-resource evidence includes wall and CPU time, peak RSS, page
faults, block I/O operations, and context switches. Failed or signalled
commands still produce evidence and retain their command outcome.
Host evidence records both visible and affinity-available logical CPUs plus
the cgroup-v2 CPU, cpuset, and memory ceilings, so a constrained runner cannot
silently look like an implementation regression.

Use one fresh recorder process and one output path per sample. The recorder
refuses to replace an existing record. It deliberately does not infer whether
a cache is cold or warm; the benchmark driver owns and proves that setup before
passing the label. Network bytes, CAS work, SQLite statements, durability
calls, complete-root scans, and internal phase timing remain separate typed
counters rather than estimates derived from elapsed time.

## Remi Conversion Benchmark Methodology

The command invocation and subject-selection contract remain in
[the Remi module guide](../modules/remi.md#conversion-benchmark-evidence).

`--work-root` must name a new directory outside the live Remi storage root.
The Remi service and every other one-shot runtime owner must be stopped. The
command acquires the existing runtime root's exclusive kernel lock before it
snapshots the operational SQLite database and retains that lock through strict
reopen of the durable report. This keeps activation and catalog garbage
collection from changing the registered catalog set during the run. It clears runtime
conversion/cache state in that copy, stages the admitted source artifact, and
places every mutation below the work root. Deployed catalogs, signing keys, and
the source database remain read-only authorities; the benchmark cannot warm or
otherwise mutate live conversion state. Use a distinct new work root for every
subject and revision being compared.

The strict `conversion-benchmark-v8.json` report records the exact binary path
and digest, source commit and dirty state, Remi and host identity, CPU and
memory, and the device, filesystem, and block size for every authority and
scratch root. It pins each profile and source resource, catalog artifact,
logical digest, portable-manifest digest and size, and exact chunk geometry as
well as the benchmark subject.

Before conversion repetitions, `setup.prepare`, `setup.profile`,
`setup.source`, and `setup.finalize` are separately bounded, non-overlapping
setup phases. Evidence assembly between probes is excluded rather than charged
to the next phase.
The profile and source records separately expose `reopen` and required
authority-`query` work; query VFS counters are checked deltas from the owning
reader at the end of its reopen. VFS snapshot extraction is included in the
phase it describes. Each phase records process wall/user/system
time, RSS endpoints and process-lifetime peak, faults, logical bytes and
syscalls from `/proc/self/io`, storage bytes, context switches, and endpoint
thread occupancy. Cancelled-write bytes are a signed phase delta, so a counter
regression is retained rather than rejected. Each catalog record also names
exact verification-pass
evidence and authenticated-VFS read/chunk/cache work. Schema-v6 validation requires exactly one
compact portable-manifest validation, one stored-binding check, demanded VFS
authentication with no integrity failure, and zero complete userspace catalog
hash, SQLite integrity scan, or logical replay. The chosen chunk size, count,
and proof size must agree exactly with catalog geometry.

Each repetition separates `conversion_core` from `end_to_end`, records the same
process resource counters, and retains phase timings and deterministic work
counters. Successful cold evidence independently reopens the signed transport
and hashes the complete CCS archive; the report records the CCS, transport,
and canonical signed-object-set identities and byte counts.

Schema v6 retains exact native payload amplification evidence. The
`native_payload_spool_file_reopens` counter records each successful physical
reopen after spooling, including an open of a zero-length file, while
`native_payload_spool_bytes_reread` records bytes actually read through those
reopens. For a cold RPM conversion, validation requires declared bytes to
equal spooled bytes and both reopen counters to be zero. The RPM decoder pairs
the exact `FILEDIGESTALGO` with every `FILEDIGESTS` value and produces typed,
algorithm-tagged evidence during its bounded decode/spool copy. Code 8 shares
the content SHA-256 state, so `native_payload_bytes_hashed` is exactly one
times spooled bytes; every other supported file-digest algorithm runs one
concurrent declared-digest state, so it is exactly two times spooled bytes.
Additive CPIO CRC work is excluded from that cryptographic counter.

Schema v6 hard-cuts the former split payload-reference derivation and payload-
object emission paths. One `payload_derivation_and_object_staging` phase opens
each regular content owner once, validates its whole-content identity, derives
canonical chunk identities where required, and writes each unique staged
object once. Its counters separately record source opens/bytes, zero source
reopens/rereads, chunk-identity and whole-content SHA-256 input, their checked
aggregate, unique writes, deduplicated occurrences/bytes, and zero canonical
staging rereads or durability calls. The retired phases, nested temporary-
staging timing, and second-pass/temp-incoming-hash fields are absent rather than
reported as zero. Prepared layouts and the exact unique object census must
match final v3 authority before signing.

The two current reopen timers have different owners and boundaries. The
`timing.phases` entry named `independent_transport_reopen` consumes the
converter's typed pending artifact, verifies it under the exact profile targets
key, and streams its signed objects into permanent CAS. It remains inside the
`end_to_end` view and is the sole internal verification/finalization boundary.
`output.independent_transport_reopen_ms` is instead a benchmark-only proof
performed after the end-to-end conversion call. It is inside the outer
repetition process envelope but outside both views, and it is never credited as
a conversion optimization. The adjacent
`output.independent_complete_archive_hash_ms` is also post-conversion proof.

The internal independent transport reopen streams signed object bytes directly
into the permanent verified-CAS batch. The current schema-v8 contract
attributes that fused wall time once to `independent_transport_reopen` and
records `durable_cas_ingestion` as skipped with the exact reason
`fused into independent transport reopen; no post-verification object pass`.
The `independent_transport_reopen_object_bytes_hashed` and
`cas_incoming_bytes_hashed` counters therefore describe the same physical hash
pass and must agree with the signed object byte count; they are not additive.
An isolated cold benchmark starts with an empty application CAS, so its
missing-object bytes are written once behind one staged-data and one
canonical-name barrier. A hot repetition has zero conversion `timing.work`,
but the benchmark still performs its separate output proof; outer process wall
time is therefore not hot service latency.

CCS archive emission uses one portable Rust canonical MGZIP representation with
fixed ordered 1 MiB DEFLATE blocks. Authenticated reopen validates every exact
header, encoded-size bound, DEFLATE completion, decoded-size footer, and CRC,
returns decoded bytes in carrier order, and rejects ordinary gzip, malformed or
short blocks, and trailing bytes. Reordered or substituted valid blocks cannot
survive the canonical tar layout plus signed object authority. Remi derives one
shared bounded archive-CPU capacity from logical parallelism; emission and
reopen lease that capacity without oversubscription. The raw and public records
carry exact encode and decode workers, blocks, bytes, and checked buffer
ceilings. Existing pre-alpha single-member CCS artifacts require rebuild; no
compatibility reader remains.

Schema v8 retains the schema-v4 hard cut that removed the former
converter-owned immediate reopen and its inferred work fields entirely; it is
not represented by a zero-duration or skipped compatibility phase. Foreign
conversion now returns a typed pending artifact. Remi storage consumes that
value and is the only code that can hand a verified conversion to transport
construction and persistence. A signature, archive, object, or
reconstructed-layout failure therefore still terminates before transport,
chunk bookkeeping, or conversion rows become authoritative.
The writer hashes every compressed output byte beneath its MGZIP write and
binds that identity into the pending value. Remi first copies those bytes into
a same-directory private file below `cache/packages`, synchronizes and seals it
`0400` as defense-in-depth read-only mode, and makes that exact path the sole
verifier input while signed objects stream directly into permanent CAS. It
then hard-links that staged inode under the verifier-produced digest name
without replacement and independently hashes the opened canonical final inode.
A preexisting digest name is reused only when it is itself one sealed regular
file with the exact verified size and digest. The staging name and an
inode-bound publication guard remain owned through the
conversion-row commit together with the exact read-only final file descriptor
used for that one canonical hash. Every later binding compares the pathname to
that held descriptor's regular-file device, inode, size, and sealed mode before
bookkeeping and inside the conversion transaction. Digest names are append-only
during the running service: request failure retires only its private staging
name, and any future reclamation of unreferenced digest artifacts must run as
exclusive stopped-runtime garbage collection. This avoids a conditional-unlink
race with concurrent reuse or replacement. Portable regular-file permissions
do not defend against an arbitrary writer already holding the same service
principal's authority; that principal also controls Remi's database, keys, and
CAS and is outside this boundary. Consequently the cold phase order is
`complete_archive_copy`, `independent_transport_reopen`, then
`complete_archive_hash`; each byte counter covers its exact full-archive pass,
while `ccs_output_bytes_hashed` records the fused authoring hash.

The first successful repetition must be `cold`. Every later successful
repetition must be an exact `hot` hit with no conversion-core work. Failures
remain typed evidence rather than being relabeled or silently retried. The
first failure terminates the repetition sequence, including a failure in the
independent persisted-output reopen after conversion succeeds. A conversion
failure carries zero unexecuted views; the distinct independent-output-reopen
failure retains the completed conversion's cache state, timing, and executed
views while omitting the output proof that could not be authenticated. Missing
timing or contradictory cache/view evidence is a fatal harness-contract defect,
not a valid repetition failure. The terminal failure is validated, atomically
published, and independently reopened before the command reports its nonzero
outcome.
Schema-v6 validation rejects inconsistent authority, reopen evidence,
iteration, cache-state, timing, or output proof before atomically publishing
the report, then deserializes and compares the durable report before success.
The validator binds `end_to_end` to the timing total, recomputes
`conversion_core` from its owned phases, requires each independent complete
reopen/hash byte count to equal the CCS size, and requires every hot output
identity and byte geometry to equal the cold result. A commit-worthy
baseline uses a clean exact source commit, preserves the complete JSON report,
and compares identical authority, subject, parsed source, host/filesystem
geometry, and signed-object-set identities while retaining each run's exact
source commit and binary digest. Whole CCS and transport wrapper identities are
exact within each cold/hot pair; their timestamped signatures make them
time-varying across separately executed conversions. The recorded counters are
regression evidence; they do not weaken conversion verification or storage
authority. Recorded baselines and measured optimizations follow below.

A successful command also atomically publishes
`conversion-benchmark-public-v6.json`. This strict sidecar binds the exact raw
schema-v8 bytes by size and SHA-256 and carries the complete safe authority,
setup, process, VFS, phase, work, view, and output-proof evidence without
rounding. It omits the executable path, every storage-root path and device ID,
and the free-form explanation attached to skipped phases. Failed or dirty-source
reports never receive a public sidecar. Both files are create-only, mode 0600,
atomically and durably published, strictly reopened, and value-compared before
success; the raw report remains the local diagnostic authority.

`.github/workflows/remi-conversion-benchmark.yml` is the sole production
adapter. It binds an exact successful protected deployment and accepts one
explicit registered profile-revision digest so before-and-after binaries can
be compared against identical retained authority even after the current
candidate advances. It authenticates source bytes before and after transport,
serializes against deployment, and invokes the fixed root-owned helper. The
helper runs exactly one cold and one hot iteration on XFS while Remi is
trap-backed stopped, then restores liveness. Only the public sidecar and its
deployment/source bindings leave the host; workflow validation requires two
successful repetitions, exact requested subject identity, clean deployed
source and binary identity, and XFS for every retained root role.

The isolated harness exercises local verified-CAS durability separately from
cloud publication. `r2_write_through` is therefore recorded as skipped with a
typed reason; the command has no R2 credentials or destination arguments.
Cloud durability performance requires a separate benchmark against an
explicitly isolated R2 prefix.

## Remi direct verified-CAS pre-change anchor: 2026-08-30

Protected production-XFS workflow
[run 33282246922](https://github.com/FieldmouseWorks/Conary/actions/runs/33282246922)
is the exact pre-#755 comparison anchor. It ran workflow commit
`d5c7901734e8c0643f6b718480f56f6e07ef2a43`, selected deployment
`33278154553`, and measured deployed Remi commit
`2a8faeb9de6e29afc2883c3b52f87c24c306b3e4`, version 0.16.1, binary SHA-256
`11680ebb982e49fb38c8eca1d87e87525c8298c8543de327b94e781f4a88bc02`.
The pinned subject was Fedora profile `fedora-44`, revision

`7646cb1313853d1a8ae069e3c42967fccdf417d178bc647bbaa500a3b1753fc4`,
and the 1,881,853,676-byte source with SHA-256
`986cfa5c47b82141f298aefa66b4c68008568b1d00abd80dece8e3d50cd7c73e`.

The sole workflow artifact was ID `9723420073`, 35,038 bytes, with matching API

`24778fc85b8073bc90daad75585181ec36e72321a3cdfb539622d2590255fb80`.
Its public projection was 26,445 bytes with SHA-256
`6df7d8becdc467a17d87558e1974a87b67ed5811a2b66d32f8717e75138a978f`;
that projection binds the 30,186-byte private raw schema-v3 report at SHA-256
`075324524bd620bf576654f67d2415f27ad80e2483c86a68fec3d16c15425408`.
This commit-bound pre-change schema-v3 record retains the formerly executed CAS
phase. It is immutable comparison input, not evidence satisfying the current
fused-phase validation rule.

| Measurement boundary | Cold value | Meaning for #755 |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Repetition process wall | 295.524674 s | Includes conversion and later benchmark output proof |
| `views.end_to_end` | 246.678 s | Service conversion call compared before and after |
| `views.conversion_core` | 163.994 s | Includes converter-owned immediate reopen |
| phase `immediate_converter_reopen` | 39.100 s | Converter verification; not the fusion target |
| phase `independent_transport_reopen` | 38.282 s | Internal verification half of the fusion target |
| phase `durable_cas_ingestion` | 17.974 s | Retired second object-source pass |
| output `independent_transport_reopen_ms` | 40.099 s | Separate post-conversion proof; never credited |
| output `independent_complete_archive_hash_ms` | 7.876 s | Separate post-conversion complete CCS hash |

The correct pre-change target boundary and comparison formulas are:

```text
before_target_ms     = 38,282 + 17,974 = 56,256
target_improvement   = 56,256 - fused_after_ms
total_improvement    = 246,678 - total_after_ms
before_residual_ms   = 246,678 - 56,256 = 190,422
residual_improvement = 190,422 - (total_after_ms - fused_after_ms)
```

Deleting only the 17.974-second second pass with every other phase fixed gives
`246.678 - 17.974 = 228.704` seconds. The 17.974-second saving is 7.286% of the
cold total and 31.950% of the 56.256-second target boundary; 228.704 seconds is
only the corresponding arithmetic total ceiling, not a latency forecast. The
after report must execute one fused internal
`independent_transport_reopen`, skip `durable_cas_ingestion` with the fixed
reason `fused into independent transport reopen; no post-verification object
pass`, and retain the separate output proof.

Within that pre-change run, both repetitions returned the identical cached
1,950,687,822-byte CCS at SHA-256
`3b7b0afbaf1b63d32c5c82aa783f1beb1c8278b16b4e4addd792ef94c02866a0`,
transport SHA-256
`37502b624ea15f5195fc139fec85a9c4b41213c659d431f175ae3ea8a7fc9fb8`,
and 49,091-object, 2,639,374,118-byte signed set at SHA-256
`cf4f448fdcf9f228febaf1767c98adbb0ca2053de4bfe231d7291f7ecf23d186`.
A cross-run comparison must preserve the complete catalog authority, subject,
verified profile/package/source identity, parsed conversion-source identity,
host and filesystem geometry, signed object-set identity, and substantive
conversion work. Each report still binds its own exact deployment commit and
binary. A comparison must not require the whole CCS or transport hashes and
byte lengths to match across separately executed conversions:
`SigningKeyPair::sign` records the current RFC 3339 time in `MANIFEST.sig`, and
the transport envelope retains that signature JSON. Those authenticated wrapper
identities must match between the cold result and its cached hot repetition, but
they are intentionally time-varying between independent runs. Cross-run
comparisons report the exact wrapper difference and compare every non-wrapper
work counter rather than silently treating the wrappers as deterministic.

Cold work hashed and persistently wrote 2,639,374,118 incoming CAS bytes across
49,091 misses, with one staged-data barrier and one canonical-name barrier.
`cas_canonical_bytes_reread`, `cas_fallback_object_syncs`, and
`cas_fallback_directory_syncs` were all zero on XFS and must remain zero after
fusion. In the fused result, verifier object hashing and CAS incoming hashing
describe this same physical pass and must not be added. Hot conversion work,
including all CAS counters and barriers, was zero. Its 0.412-second
`end_to_end` view must be distinguished from 48.578324 seconds of outer process
wall, which includes a 39.394-second independent output reopen and a
7.891-second complete archive hash.

All ten retained roots reported XFS. Exact profile and source queries demanded
6,291,456 and 6,619,136 carrier bytes respectively across 11,102,527,488
catalog bytes, with zero complete userspace catalog hashes,
SQLite integrity scans, logical replays, short reads, or integrity failures.
This anchor is one sample; its eventual exact before/after pair is paired
evidence, not a distribution. `cold` means empty application conversion, cache,
and CAS state; it does not mean the kernel page cache was dropped. R2 was
intentionally excluded, and this evidence does not constitute a same-host
native-package-manager performance comparison.

| Measurement boundary | Before | After | Change |

The fused phase measured 6.858 seconds longer than the old verification-only
half of the boundary, 45.140 versus 38.282 seconds. Unlike that former
temporary-spool verification boundary, it owns permanent-CAS missing-object
writes and both durability barriers; this single sample does not attribute the
entire phase delta causally. Removing the old 17.974-second second CAS pass
still produced the measured 11.116-second target-boundary win. The additional
1.923-second residual change is reported separately instead of being credited
to fusion. The 16-millisecond hot difference is one-sample variance on an
unchanged exact-cache path, whose conversion work remained all zero.

Cold logical reads fell from 39,241,805,642 to 36,602,432,246 bytes and logical
writes from 20,994,530,380 to 18,355,156,589 bytes. Each reduction is within
one kilobyte of the exact 2,639,374,118-byte signed object set, which is the
physical-pass removal #755 targeted. The after run hashed and persistently
wrote that exact set across 49,091 CAS misses, retained one staged-data and one
canonical-name barrier, and recorded zero CAS hits, race losers, canonical
reread bytes, fallback object syncs, or fallback directory syncs.

The stable signed object set remained exact at SHA-256
`cf4f448fdcf9f228febaf1767c98adbb0ca2053de4bfe231d7291f7ecf23d186`,
49,091 objects, and 2,639,374,118 bytes. Every substantive cold work counter
also matched the anchor. The independently signed CCS wrapper was 131 bytes
larger, 1,950,687,953 bytes, at SHA-256
`b08b08015ef5e75d8f3e02fb3c73790057ee5c851dd5e2b92d341484f6867774`;
its transport SHA-256 was
`88ad41722f940c7f1e49ed600bb6f59b701aca86ba5634fa14742cc62f353f6b`.
Accordingly, only the six cold `timing.work` counters derived from complete CCS
wrapper length grew by 131 bytes; the three corresponding `output` byte fields
reported the same geometry. This is the expected timestamped-signature
variation described above, not changed payload work or a #755 converter-output
change.

This result is one paired production sample, not a latency distribution. It
proves the named direct-CAS physical-pass improvement and does not constitute a
same-host native-package-manager performance comparison.

## Single-finalizer pre-change anchor: 2026-08-30

Issue #765 selects the next physical amplification from the exact merged-#755
result above. The converter-owned immediate reopen consumed 38.720 seconds,
23.937% of the 161.755-second conversion core. It read and decompressed the
1,950,687,953-byte CCS, authenticated the 49,091-object,
2,639,374,118-byte signed set into a disposable spool, reconstructed the signed
FastCDC layouts, and then discarded the complete verification capability.
Remi immediately repeated the same archive authority under the exact profile
targets key while streaming the objects into permanent CAS.

Schema v4 therefore makes conversion emission return a typed pending artifact
and leaves one internal finalizer: `independent_transport_reopen`. The
arithmetic ceilings with every other duration fixed are 123.035 seconds for
`conversion_core` and 194.919 seconds end to end, a 38.720-second or 16.573%
end-to-end reduction. These are pass-removal ceilings, not measured results;
the protected production-XFS rerun must establish the realized change and
retain the separate benchmark-only reopen/hash proof outside both views.

The writer now computes the exact compressed output SHA-256 inline beneath
gzip as `ccs_output_sha256`; `ccs_output_bytes_hashed` records the exact work,
so the pending value is bound to the authored bytes without another file pass.
Remi records three disjoint full-archive operations in physical order: the copy
into sealed same-directory staging, the sole verifier/direct-CAS finalizer, and
the canonical published inode hash. The added fused authoring hash is real CPU
work, so the arithmetic ceiling above is deliberately not treated as a
realized forecast.

The measured core is 9.451 seconds above the 123.035-second pass-removal
ceiling, and measured end to end is 17.090 seconds above the 194.919-second
ceiling, realizing 75.591% and 55.863% of the corresponding arithmetic
pass-removal improvements. The authoring phase now includes the exact inline
compressed-output hash and took 8.396 seconds longer in this sample. The
retained verifier and direct-CAS phase took 7.814 seconds longer. These are
observed phase changes, not causal attribution from one sample. The
29-millisecond sealed staging copy did not create the feared multi-second copy
boundary on this XFS run.

The benchmark-only output proof remains outside both timing views. Its cold
independent reopen changed from 39.380 to 45.731 seconds, while its complete
archive hash changed from 7.899 to 7.265 seconds. Those changes explain why
the outer process wall improved less than the end-to-end view. The hot
conversion remained an exact cache hit with zero conversion work; its larger
outer wall likewise reflects the independent output proof rather than hot-path
conversion work.

The logical-read reduction is within 585 bytes of the retired CCS reopen plus
reconstructed-content work. The logical-write reduction is within 470 bytes
of the exact signed object set. Those independent process counters support the
typed pass-removal evidence without treating storage-read variation as causal.

Schema v4 contains no executed or skipped `immediate_converter_reopen` phase
and no retired immediate-reopen counters. It records exactly one internal
verifier, after `complete_archive_copy` and before `complete_archive_hash`.
The writer hashed all 1,950,687,824 CCS bytes inline, and the copy, retained
reopen, canonical hash, and output geometry each bind that exact length. The
retained verifier and CAS incoming counters each describe the same
2,639,374,118 signed-object bytes and must not be added as separate passes.

The stable signed set remained exact at SHA-256
`cf4f448fdcf9f228febaf1767c98adbb0ca2053de4bfe231d7291f7ecf23d186`,
49,091 objects, and 2,639,374,118 bytes. All substantive cold work counters
matched #755 after excluding the retired/new schema fields and time-varying
signed-wrapper geometry. The new CCS was 129 bytes smaller at SHA-256
`b590929e13a8164bf939ce337c33a567b430f4e7bc4b9a56440849417ad25531`;
its transport SHA-256 was
`4d2383c289d748ea48a396404eb4826ea34a5f914f0cd2d602326c7a49cde4de`.
Cold and hot identities and byte lengths matched within the run. The
cross-run wrapper difference is the expected timestamped-signature variation,
not payload-work drift.

Cold CAS admission retained 49,091 misses, the exact signed byte count, one
staged-data barrier, one canonical-name barrier, and zero hits, race losers,
canonical reread bytes, or fallback syncs. R2 remained disabled. Both catalog
reopens retained one portable-manifest validation and one stored binding check;
their authenticated VFS reads had zero complete userspace hashes, SQLite
integrity scans, logical replays, short reads, or integrity failures.

This is one paired production sample, not a latency distribution. `cold`
still means empty application conversion, cache, and CAS state rather than a
dropped kernel page cache. It proves the exact single-finalizer physical-pass
change and does not constitute a same-host native-package-manager comparison.

## RPM file-digest fusion pre-change anchor: 2026-08-30

The same protected production-XFS run
[33295190850](https://github.com/FieldmouseWorks/Conary/actions/runs/33295190850)
at deployed commit `44a345e5650a8fefe21508f10b2c689abf00a1e6` is the
exact pre-#766 anchor. Its cold `native_archive_parse_and_spool` phase took
23.567 seconds. RPM decode produced 21,636 spool files and
2,757,056,284 spooled bytes while reading 2,761,335,228 decompressed archive
bytes. Projection then physically reopened 21,083 regular content sources and
reread all 2,757,056,284 content bytes. The other 553 spool files were
zero-byte non-owner hardlink members and were not projection sources.

The schema-v4 instrumentation reported zero
`native_payload_spool_bytes_reread` and only 2,757,056,284
`native_payload_bytes_hashed`. The implementation had actually performed a
second SHA-256 over the reopened content, so its cryptographic hash input was
5,514,112,568 bytes. Those counters therefore described only the decode/spool
pass and hid the complete projection reopen, reread, and duplicate hash.

At the measured #766 step, schema v5 hard-cut the raw report and schema v3
hard-cut its public projection. That historical run's raw filename was
`conversion-benchmark-v5.json`; its public filename was
`conversion-benchmark-public-v3.json`. Schema v5 added exact
`native_payload_spool_file_reopens` accounting, including successful opens of
zero-length files, and makes `native_payload_spool_bytes_reread` describe the
bytes physically read after spooling. `native_payload_bytes_hashed` is the
aggregate input presented to cryptographic hash states: one times spooled
bytes when RPM `FILEDIGESTALGO` code 8 shares the content SHA-256, or two times
spooled bytes when another supported `FILEDIGESTALGO` requires a concurrent
declared-digest state alongside content SHA-256. Additive CPIO CRC work is not
cryptographic hash input.

RPM projection now consumes typed, algorithm-tagged evidence derived from
`FILEDIGESTALGO` and `FILEDIGESTS` during the bounded decode/spool copy. It does
not reopen payload files to reconstruct that evidence. For this code-8
FlightGear subject, the resulting improvement is projected at approximately
10.3 seconds. That linear estimate applies the same run's independent complete
archive SHA-256 rate (1,950,687,824 bytes in 7.265 seconds) to the hidden
2,757,056,284-byte reread; it is not a measurement and does not assume that
many-file reopen overhead is identical. A protected schema-v5 production run
must establish the realized change.

The targeted phase improved by 10.920 seconds, closely matching and slightly
exceeding the transparent approximately 10.3-second pre-change projection.
The larger 15.896-second conversion-core improvement also includes a
4.523-second lower archive-assembly sample. Conversely, the sealed archive
copy and retained verifier sampled 1.433 and 1.317 seconds higher. Those
observations explain the measured propagation boundaries but are not causal
attribution from one sample. The separate benchmark-only output proof remained
outside both timing views and was essentially flat.

Schema v5 proves the physical change directly. The RPM projection's corrected
baseline was 21,083 successful spool-file reopens, 2,757,056,284 reread bytes,
and 5,514,112,568 cryptographic hash-input bytes. The measured result is zero
reopens, zero reread bytes, and 2,757,056,284 hash-input bytes: one shared
SHA-256 pass over the code-8 FlightGear content. The 2,757,056,282-byte
process-level logical-read reduction is within two bytes of the eliminated
reread and independently supports the typed counters.

The source geometry stayed exact at 24,096 payload entries, 21,083 regular
files, 21,636 spool files, 2,757,056,284 declared and spooled bytes, and
2,761,335,228 decompressed archive bytes. The later CCS-emission boundary
still reopened 21,083 payload files and read 2,757,056,284 object bytes; it is
not the eliminated native-projection pass. The stable signed set remained
exact at SHA-256
`cf4f448fdcf9f228febaf1767c98adbb0ca2053de4bfe231d7291f7ecf23d186`,
49,091 objects, and 2,639,374,118 bytes. Cold and hot outputs agreed within the
run; cross-run CCS and transport digests changed only with the expected
timestamped wrapper material.

This is one paired production sample, not a latency distribution. `cold`
still means empty application conversion, cache, and CAS state rather than a
dropped kernel page cache. It proves the exact RPM file-digest fusion and does
not constitute a same-host native-package-manager performance comparison.

## One-pass CCS payload preparation pre-change anchor: 2026-08-30

The same protected production-XFS run
[33299133807](https://github.com/FieldmouseWorks/Conary/actions/runs/33299133807)
is the exact pre-#771 anchor. After native decode, CCS reference derivation took
12.846 seconds and object emission took 35.871 seconds, or 48.717 seconds
combined. Those phases operated over 21,083 regular content owners totaling
2,757,056,284 bytes. Of that set, 7,967 files and 2,726,080,028 bytes used the
canonical FastCDC layout; 13,116 files and 30,976,256 bytes used whole objects.

The split implementation opened the 7,967 chunked sources once for reference
derivation, then reopened all 21,083 regular sources for object emission. It
therefore performed 29,050 payload-source opens and read 5,483,136,312 source
bytes. The instrumented hash counters covered 10,935,296,368 bytes: first-pass
chunk identities, second-pass chunk identities, second-pass large-file whole
content, and temporary-store incoming object identities. Duplicate verification
then SHA-256-hashed another 117,682,166 canonical reread bytes, making the
complete physical payload-boundary cryptographic input 11,052,978,534 bytes.
The store attempted 51,434 objects, wrote all 2,757,056,284 attempted bytes,
and reread those 117,682,166 canonical duplicate bytes before emitting the
exact 49,091-object, 2,639,374,118-byte signed set.

Schema v6 and public schema v4 replace that split evidence with one
`payload_derivation_and_object_staging` phase. The exact target for the pinned
subject is 21,083 source opens, 2,757,056,284 source bytes, zero source reopens
or reread bytes, 2,726,080,028 chunk-identity hash bytes,
2,757,056,284 whole-content hash bytes, and 5,483,136,312 aggregate payload
crypto bytes. Staging must write only the 2,639,374,118 unique signed bytes,
avoid 117,682,166 duplicate-write bytes, and perform zero canonical staging
rereads or durability calls. Large files retain both required identities; the
work reduction does not remove whole-content validation or chunk authority.

Those are deterministic physical-work gates, not a latency promise. The merged
candidate must be deployed and rerun against the same authority, subject, XFS
host, and cache state before any realized wall/CPU/RSS improvement is claimed.
No same-host native-package-manager diagnostic has yet been recorded for this
subject.

Schema v6 proves the targeted physical change directly:

| Deterministic physical work | Before | After | Change |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Payload-source opens | 29,050 | 21,083 | -7,967 (-27.425%) |
| Payload-source bytes | 5,483,136,312 | 2,757,056,284 | -2,726,080,028 (-49.718%) |

| Canonical duplicate rereads | 117,682,166 B | 0 B | -117,682,166 B (-100%) |

The result opened each of the 21,083 regular content owners exactly once and
reported zero source reopens or reread bytes. It derived 38,318 chunks, hashed
2,726,080,028 chunk-identity bytes and 2,757,056,284 whole-content bytes, and
staged the exact 49,091 unique objects without file or shard syncs. The 2,343
duplicate objects avoided 117,682,166 bytes of writes and canonical rereads.
Eliminating those canonical rereads also eliminated their SHA-256 verification.
The stable signed set remained exact at SHA-256
`cf4f448fdcf9f228febaf1767c98adbb0ca2053de4bfe231d7291f7ecf23d186`,
49,091 objects, and 2,639,374,118 bytes. Cold and hot outputs agreed within the
run. The retained independent reopen rehashed all 2,639,374,118 signed-object
bytes; the separate complete-archive hash covered all 1,950,609,956 CCS bytes.
Registered catalog access retained the same authenticated portable-VFS
counters with no userspace full hash, SQLite integrity scan, logical replay,
or integrity failure.

This is one paired production sample, not a latency distribution. `cold`
still means empty application conversion, cache, and CAS state rather than a
dropped kernel page cache. It proves the exact one-pass payload-preparation
change and does not constitute a same-host native-package-manager performance
comparison.

The service-owned phase includes storage finalization around the exact fused
archive verifier. Its 8.857-second improvement therefore differs from the
10.456-second improvement in the separately timed exact benchmark proof. The
service-owned boundary executes only in the cold conversion; the separate
benchmark proof improved in both cold and hot repetitions. The 7.389-second
end-to-end reduction is the product-facing result; the larger outer-process
reduction also includes the benchmark-only post-conversion proof and is not
credited to service conversion.

Raw schema v8 proves that authenticated reopen admitted all 12 available CPUs
and decoded 2,569 canonical 1,048,576-byte MGZIP blocks in archive order. It
authenticated 1,950,894,143 compressed bytes, produced 2,693,046,784 decoded
bytes, SHA-256 verified all 49,091 signed objects and 2,639,374,118 object
bytes, and stayed below its exact 57,256,290-byte ordered-buffer ceiling. Cold
CAS admission recorded 49,091 misses, persisted the complete signed set, and
performed one staged-data barrier and one canonical-name barrier with zero
fallback syncs or canonical rereads. Compression retained 12 workers over the
same block geometry and stayed below its 56,102,001-byte buffer ceiling.

`cf4f448fdcf9f228febaf1767c98adbb0ca2053de4bfe231d7291f7ecf23d186`,
49,091 objects, and 2,639,374,118 bytes. Cold and hot outputs agreed within the
new run. The sole-representation hard cut intentionally changed physical CCS
and transport identity from ordinary gzip to canonical fixed-block MGZIP. The
CCS grew from 1,950,834,192 to 1,950,894,143 bytes, an increase of 59,951 bytes
or 0.0031%; this is framing overhead rather than signed-object drift.

This is one paired production sample, not a latency distribution. `cold`
still means empty application conversion, cache, and CAS state rather than a
dropped kernel page cache. It proves the exact parallel authenticated-reopen
change and does not constitute a same-host native-package-manager performance

Schema v7 proves that live admission selected 12 workers rather than the prior
static one-worker allocation. Both runs compressed 2,693,046,784 input bytes
as 2,569 ordered 1,048,576-byte blocks. The canonical checked input/output
buffering ceiling rose from 7,654,987 bytes to 56,102,001 bytes. The signed
payload set remained exact at SHA-256
`cf4f448fdcf9f228febaf1767c98adbb0ca2053de4bfe231d7291f7ecf23d186`,
49,091 objects, and 2,639,374,118 bytes, and cold/hot output identity agreed
within the run. Fixed ordered blocks retain separate unit proof that archive
bytes are independent of worker scheduling for identical controls.

This is one paired production sample, not a latency distribution. It proves
that work-conserving live CPU admission accounts for the archive and
conversion-core reduction while preserving the canonical memory bound; the
complete-copy swing is ordinary neighboring-phase noise and is not attributed
to compression. The retained authenticated `independent_transport_reopen` is
now the dominant measured boundary at 53.157 seconds, while archive assembly
is 10.476 seconds. No same-host native-package-manager diagnostic has yet been

Schema v7 proves the exact compression geometry: 2,693,046,784 input bytes,
1,048,576-byte blocks, 2,569 blocks, one worker, and a 7,654,987-byte checked
input/output buffering ceiling. The deployment kept `max_concurrent` at 32;
dividing the 12 available logical CPUs across that configured admission ceiling
therefore selected one worker. The measured 16.062% archive improvement came
from the ordered blocked gzp/zlib-rs hard cut without production parallelism;
the local multi-worker probe is not credited to this result. The signed object
set stayed byte-identical at SHA-256
`cf4f448fdcf9f228febaf1767c98adbb0ca2053de4bfe231d7291f7ecf23d186`,

This is one paired production sample, not a latency distribution. The archive
change accounts for the conversion-core reduction within ordinary neighboring
phase noise; the much lower complete-copy sample is not attributed to the
compression implementation. The new dominant measured conversion boundary is
the retained authenticated `independent_transport_reopen` at 53.210 seconds,
followed by archive assembly/compression at 45.318 seconds. No same-host native
package-manager diagnostic has yet been recorded for this subject.

## Remi conversion baseline: 2026-08-15

The raw baseline is
[remi-conversion-2026-08-15-before.jsonl](remi-conversion-2026-08-15-before.jsonl).
It was captured from release commit
981e051b626d700765e3cf1f2489009351c133c0 on the
remi-i7-8700-raid1 hardware label with an isolated authenticated Fedora 44
metadata snapshot and R2 disabled.

| Class | Source bytes | Cold total | Hot total | Hot download | Hot checksum |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| small | 6,733 | 417 ms | 331 ms | 314 ms | 0 ms |
| median | 51,633 | 524 ms | 498 ms | 482 ms | 1 ms |
| large | 1,881,853,676 | 289,984 ms | 47,595 ms | 39,957 ms | 7,005 ms |

The cold large-package profile is dominated by CCS emission at 130,822 ms.
The first bounded optimization targets a separate, unambiguous hot-path cost:
an exact metadata-bound cache hit still downloads and hashes the entire source
artifact. Download plus checksum account for 46,962 ms (98.7%) of the large hot
sample and repeat 3,763,707,352 bytes of transfer and source hashing across its
cold/hot pair.

The targeted result is
[remi-conversion-2026-08-15-after.jsonl](remi-conversion-2026-08-15-after.jsonl).
It was captured on the same hardware and byte-identical clean metadata
snapshot from release commit
31438a532160526f83b739e7681b7e01b985b145.

| Class | Before hot | After hot | Improvement | After hot transfer/hash |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| small | 331 ms | 10 ms | 97.0% | 0 / 0 bytes |
| median | 498 ms | 12 ms | 97.6% | 0 / 0 bytes |
| large | 47,595 ms | 381 ms | 99.2% | 0 / 0 bytes |

The fix moves the exact source-checksum and repository-capability-bound cache
lookup before source transfer. Across the three hot samples it avoids
1,881,912,042 bytes of transfer and the same amount of source hashing. Cold
totals remained in the same workload shape (514 ms, 565 ms, and 269,813 ms);
their network-dependent elapsed-time differences are not attributed to the
cache-hit fix.


## Update artifact acquisition guard (#965)

Artifact-backed update planning authenticates full packages before it can prove
lifecycle, relation, enrollment, and payload effects. Apply reuses those exact
retained artifacts in the same admitted order. Downloading a delta afterward
cannot avoid the already-acquired full bytes, so that redundant acquisition and
reconstruction path is removed.

`cargo test -p conary --features test-hooks --test update_artifact_acquisition -- --nocapture`
uses a private signed repository and loopback response counters. It crosses an
absent/present signed-full-archive CAS object with valid/invalid advertised
deltas. The base delta object is present in both cache conditions; the warm
condition additionally stores the signed full archive. Both still require one
full-artifact GET and exactly its response-payload length, with zero delta GETs
or response-payload bytes. Counters are separate from installed version and
committed effects. The fixture uses explicit test-only mount fencing and makes
no real-mount, elapsed-time, or total-wire-bandwidth claim.

The update summary captures additionally preserve cancellation, relation-order,
preview/apply equivalence, earlier committed failures, and full-artifact
preparation accounting. Historical delta statistics remain readable; new runs
record no delta attempt or unearned savings. A future delta-only planning path
must authenticate the same exact lifecycle/relation/enrollment authority before
it can claim avoided full-artifact acquisition.
