# Conary Architecture

This document describes the internal architecture of Conary, a modern system
manager written in Rust. It covers the major subsystems, their interactions,
and the data flow for core operations.

## System Overview

```
apps/conary/ (CLI)
  cli/ + app.rs + dispatch.rs + dispatch/
      |
      +-- install / update / remove
      +-- repo / publish / cook / new / try / query / model / ccs / collection
      +-- system generation / state / takeover
      +-- bootstrap / provenance / capability / federation
      |
      v
crates/conary-core/
  repository --> resolver --> transaction --> generation / filesystem --> db
      |               |             |                |                  |
      |               |             |                +-- composefs/EROFS
      |               |             +-- CAS + SQLite commit lifecycle
      |               +-- SAT resolution + routing policy
      +-- remote metadata, static repos, Remi client, mirrors, substituters

Supporting workspace members
  apps/remi/         public/admin package service, search, federation, MCP
  apps/conaryd/      local daemon, auth, job queue, REST/SSE routes, package execution
  apps/conary-test/  integration harness, CLI, Remi result client, container runners
  crates/conary-bootstrap/ shared tracing/runtime/exit helpers for workspace binaries
  crates/conary-agent-contract/ transport-neutral agent operation contract
  crates/conary-mcp/ shared MCP adapter helpers
```

## Workspace, Artifact, and Release Boundaries

The Cargo workspace is organized by code ownership, not by publication unit.
Its eight packages have focused dependency boundaries, while four packages
produce shipped artifacts and the whole workspace shares one release authority:

| Boundary | Count | Authority |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Cargo package | 8 | Owns a focused code surface and dependency API |
| Artifact product | 4 | Owns construction and deployment routing for `conary`, `remi`, `conaryd`, or `conary-test` |
| Suite release | 1 | Owns the workspace version, reviewed source commit, canonical `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` tag, and GitHub release |

The root `[workspace.package]` table owns the version, Rust edition, minimum
toolchain, authors, license, and disabled Cargo-registry publication policy
inherited by every member. Conary publishes the synchronized source suite and
its named artifacts through GitHub; workspace packages are not separate
crates.io release tracks.
`conary-core` owns shared package-management behavior;
`conary-bootstrap` owns common binary startup;
`conary-agent-contract` owns transport-neutral operation types; and
`conary-mcp` adapts that contract to MCP. The application packages remain the
artifact entrypoints. `conaryd` reuses Conary command behavior through the
adapter boundary documented in `docs/modules/conaryd.md`, while `conary-test`
consumes product contracts without owning runtime release authority.

One synchronized release still preserves distinct operational behavior:
Conary and Remi have protected deployment lanes, while conaryd and conary-test
are build-only artifacts. Those routes are serialized in suite metadata; they
do not create separate version or tag authorities.

## Core Concepts

### Trove

The fundamental unit. A trove represents a package, component, or collection.
Each trove has a name, version (epoch:version-release), and optional flavor.
Troves are stored in the `troves` table with install reason tracking
(explicit vs dependency) and optional label provenance.

### Changeset

A durable transaction record. Install, remove, and update paths create a
changeset entry so pending, applied, failed, and rolled-back outcomes remain
explicit. Database, guarded live-root, and generation paths have different
recovery guarantees; a changeset does not promise universal filesystem
rollback. Each changeset carries a UUID for crash-recovery correlation.

### Flavor

Build-time variations expressed as `[ssl, !debug, is: x86_64]`. Flavors use
three operators: `~` (prefers), `!` (not), `~!` (prefers not). Architecture
flavors (`is: x86_64`) constrain package selection to compatible platforms.

### Label

Package provenance in `repository@namespace:tag` format. Labels form a
searchable path with priority ordering and support delegation chains to
other labels or repositories.

### Derived Package

A package created by modifying an existing package (the parent) with
patches and file overrides. Derived packages track their parent and
can be flagged as stale when the parent updates.

## Module Map

```

`conary-core` is currently an internal workspace crate. Its broad module exports
exist for workspace app reuse and integration tests, not as a stable external
API or SDK promise. The crate is marked `publish = false`; a curated public
facade would need its own design if Conary later supports external library
consumers.

## Data Flow: Package Installation

This is the primary operation. The flow from
`conary install nginx --yes`:

```
1. RESOLVE
   +-- Parse package specifier (name, version constraint, repo)
   +-- Check per-package routing strategy (Remi, delegate, or one exact
       authenticated repository-package row)
   +-- Query repositories or Remi server for package metadata
   |   +-- Static indexes carry typed provides and requirement expressions
   |   +-- String dependency lists are not resolution authority
   +-- Resolve transitive dependencies via dependency graph
   +-- Check for conflicts, pinned packages, redirects

2. PREPARE
   +-- Download package(s) - parallel via rayon if multiple
   |   +-- For Remi: fetch CCS chunks, assemble package
   |   +-- For foreign formats: download RPM/DEB/Arch package file
   +-- Parse identity and provisions into lossless RPM, Debian, or ALPM authority
   |   +-- Explicit fallible projections serve resolution and CCS v3 signing
   |   +-- #105 removes the remaining common config-declaration bridge
   +-- Detect package format (magic bytes or extension)
   +-- Convert RPM/DEB/Arch input to source-independent CCS on-the-fly
   +-- Resolve source requirements against the typed host capability inventory
   |   +-- arch/ABI/libc/loader, init, LSM, filesystem, boot/kernel, helpers
   |   +-- Source format and host capabilities are orthogonal typed axes
   |   +-- No pairwise distro converters or distro-name/string gates
   +-- Preflight typed lifecycle plans before dry-run or mutation
   |   +-- Exact source-ABI stage, argv, trigger, and payload boundaries
   |   +-- No source package-manager process or database dependency
   |   +-- Missing semantics fail as required implementation defects

3. TRANSACTION (composefs-native)
   +-- Create TransactionEngine, acquire lock
   +-- PLAN: VFS preflight - detect file conflicts
   +-- FETCH: Store package content in CAS
   +-- DB_COMMIT: Record trove, files, components, dependencies in SQLite
   |   (Point of no return)
   +-- BUILD: Construct complete generation artifact from DB/CAS state
   +-- SELECT: Update /conary/current for next boot
   +-- POST_SCRIPTS: Run post-install scriptlets under the transaction policy
   +-- TRIGGERS: Fire matching triggers (ldconfig, mime, icons, etc.)

4. RECOVERY (on crash)
   +-- Check /conary/current for a valid generation artifact
   +-- If invalid: rebuild the selected artifact from DB/CAS state
   +-- If explicit boot-selection recovery is requested: scan generations/
```

## Data Flow: Remi Server Request

When a client requests a package from the Remi server:

```
Client                        Remi Server
  |                               |
  |  GET /v1/packages/            |
  |      fedora/nginx ----------->|
  |                               |-- Check converted package cache
  |                               |   and conversion job state
  |                               |
  |  200 OK (chunks, version) <---|  [if cached]
  |                               |
  |  202 {status: "pending"} <----|  [if not cached]
  |      + job_id                  |
  |                               |-- Fetch upstream RPM
  |  GET /v1/jobs/{id} ---------->|-- Parse + convert to CCS
  |  200 {status: "converting"}<--|-- Store chunks in CAS
  |  ...polling...                |-- Record conversion result in SQLite
  |  200 {status: "ready"} <------|
  |                               |
  |  GET /v1/chunks/{hash} ------>|-- Bloom filter check
  |  200 <chunk bytes> <----------|-- Read from local CAS
  |                               |   or redirect to R2 presigned URL
  |  (repeat for each chunk)      |
```

## Data Flow: Hermetic Recipe Cook And Project Publish

`conary cook --isolated` is the hermetic recipe build path. The command
loads the local hermetic builder config, refuses recipes with build dependencies
until dependency content locks exist, prefetches sources, and then runs Kitchen
with network disabled, pristine/no-host-mount execution, reproducibility
controls, exact source and dependency identities, diagnostic command-risk
reports, builder environment identity, and local host-vs-hermetic divergence
diagnostics. Marker-file and command-text ecosystem inference is not an
authority boundary; the signed input identity and actual offline execution are.

Project-form `conary publish <target>` uses the same hermetic Kitchen path
before adding the resulting CCS package to a static repository. The cook records
unsigned hermetic evidence in CCS provenance, but it does not create signed
build-attestation envelopes. Artifact-form
`conary publish <pkg.ccs> <target>` accepts only current signed artifacts that
pass the build-attestation and publish gates.

## System Generations

Conary can build and select immutable system-generation artifacts using EROFS
images and Linux composefs. This remains an advanced, explicitly gated path in
the limited preview.

Native adoption begins with the source-independent
`packages::InstalledInventorySnapshot` authority. RPM, dpkg, pacman, and eopkg
adapters each populate exact package identities, path owners, install reasons,
relations, configuration/lifecycle evidence, fixed-work counters, and one
deterministic snapshot token through a package-count-independent number of
manager/database reads. Single-package adoption, bulk adoption, refresh, and
takeover consume that authority rather than package-local queries. They
reacquire it immediately before commit or ownership handoff; token drift aborts
before authority changes. Takeover removes exact native identities as one
database-only batch where the manager supports transactional batch removal.

Full system adoption establishes the first complete generation input without
turning unowned host state into package ownership. One exact selected-root scan
preserves package-owned anchors and payload claims, reconciles their
materialized node/content authority, and assigns only the remaining retained
paths to one `CapturedRoot` trove. `AdoptedFull`, `Taken`, `Repository`, `File`,
and `CapturedRoot` are the finite complete generation-input sources;
`AdoptedTrack` remains metadata-only. The scanner excludes the finite
ephemeral/API/device/user domains plus Conary's own normalized runtime and
database subtrees through both lexical and resolved path authority, and refuses
a runtime root that resolves to `/`. It preserves numeric ownership, full mode and node type,
timestamps, symlink targets, CAS content, xattrs, and global hardlink topology.
Generation runtime collection consumes that persisted authority without
consulting a native package manager or its database.

```

The single boot verification policy owner is conary-core's
`generation::verity_policy::VerityPolicy`. Absence or exact `conary.verity=on`
requires a verified composefs mount; only exact `conary.verity=off` permits an
unverified mount and prints a console warning. The last occurrence wins, with
presence tracked separately: an empty or otherwise invalid final value fails
activation. A failed verified mount is fatal and is never retried without
verification. Recovery rejects generation metadata lacking the fs-verity flag
or EROFS verity digest with a typed error under the verified policy.
When recovery rebuilds a missing or damaged selected image, it finalizes
fs-verity and persists the flag alongside the builder's digest before mounting.
`generation::builder::verity` owns this finalization for both normal publication
and recovery; an explicit `off` rebuild skips enablement and mounts unverified.
Artifact fallback scanning proceeds in descending generation order and selects
the highest intact artifact eligible under the active policy. A plain artifact
is skipped under verified policy, never mounted as a fallback. Boot recovery
returns `RecoveryEvidence` with the selected generation and typed skipped-artifact
reasons; exhausted scans preserve those reasons in `RecoveryScanExhausted`.
Policy-ineligible candidates can be skipped, but a verified mount failure remains
fatal and does not trigger further selection or an unverified retry.

The deployed-system `deploy/dracut` hook invokes `conary system generation
recover`, which consumes this Rust policy before repair, artifact scanning or
mount reuse. The `packaging/dracut/90conary` generator and bootstrap-generated
`/init` cannot execute conary before switch_root: neither image installs the
binary. Core reports the validated typed policy to the CLI before recovery work;
the CLI renders the explicit-off warning through its UI, without relying on
tracing filters. Both binary-free boot paths use the same shell adapter, tested
against the Rust policy for argument precedence, rejection, mount options and
downgrade warnings. These are execution adapters, not independent policy owners.
Consolidating all three
initramfs implementations and their tool inventories is tracked in
[#863](https://github.com/FieldmouseWorks/Conary/issues/863).

### Generation Lifecycle

`root_manifest/delta.rs` owns the normalized changed-path contract and
`root_manifest/authority.rs` owns its indexed, append-only SQLite snapshot
authority. Overlay artifacts must be decoded into exact removals,
opaque-directory replacement, complete node upserts, and optional root
metadata before this boundary. Applying a delta resolves only changed paths,
changed subtrees, and affected hardlink groups; unchanged entries remain in
the parent snapshot without enumeration or cloning. Complete sorted manifests
are derived only for generation artifacts, retained materialization, recovery,
rollback publication, and GC reachability. Normal
`apps/conary/src/commands/generation/selected_root/carrier.rs` owns the typed
direct-composefs versus verified-materialized-lower decision. Runtime
selected-root sessions functionally prove the exact OverlayFS profile before
snapshot preparation can write database authority, then reuse that proof when
mounting over the exact immutable lower. They freeze and strictly unmount
before decoding the transaction upper, and never perform complete before/after
selected-root scans. With no pending publication debt, the current verified
generation `root.erofs` mounts directly as the immutable-content lower and the
typed `/etc`, `/var`, and `/srv` manifest is the top lower layer. Before that
layer is prepared, the active generation's sparse `/etc` upper is decoded as
an `/etc`-scoped delta against the indexed generation snapshot, so user edits,
whiteout deletions, new paths, and OverlayFS markers become the transaction's
typed prior authority while pristine lower-only paths remain intact. The
session strictly unmounts the transaction overlay before that nested composefs
mount. Carrier selection happens under the runtime mutation lock and before
selected-root mutation. If the already-active kernel/userspace contract lacks
registered EROFS or OverlayFS, loop-device access, or `mount.composefs`, the
ordinary package loop independently reopens the complete generation artifact
and CAS inventory and materializes that same typed root as the immutable
lower. Artifact or CAS failure remains fatal; only typed carrier
unavailability selects materialization. Generation build, switch, export, and
boot keep their stricter composefs preflight and recovery contract.

Recoverable snapshots and first-generation database authority also use an
explicit materialized lower. Retained try-session trees remain a separate
materialization consumer for namespace exposure.

Publication and rollback rows reference the same SQLite-selected-root snapshot
lineage by foreign key. The retired filesystem candidate and complete
`rollback_root` JSON copy have no current-schema reader. Revision 40 is a
pre-alpha hard cut: older databases must be rebuilt from authoritative package
and repository inputs. It retains revision 39's generation database mutation
epoch and replaces repository chunk-list columns with signed transport
envelopes.

1. **Select**: Use the latest cumulative selected-root snapshot as lower authority when publication debt is pending. Otherwise decode the current generation's sparse config upper into the indexed prior snapshot, then either mount the verified composefs image directly beneath that updated typed mutable-state layer or, when the typed direct-carrier probe is unavailable, materialize the same verified generation authority; first-generation database authority also reconstructs the complete lower
2. **Mutate**: Apply payload changes, typed native lifecycle, CCS hooks, triggers, and config decisions inside that isolated root
3. **Record**: Freeze and strictly unmount, decode the upper into a typed changed-path delta, validate and append only affected indexed authority, and bind recoverable publication debt to that child snapshot before committing package state
4. **Build**: Validate the captured manifests and serialize the immutable manifest to EROFS using verified CAS content
5. **Materialize state**: Reopen the artifact, metadata, EROFS, root/state/CAS manifests, and boot contract; require every manifest-listed CAS path and size, while reusing the content identity verified at CAS ingestion instead of rehashing the complete immutable payload set. Project `/etc/...` manifest paths into the generation-local `/etc` overlay upper without retaining the `/etc` prefix, reading only the exact state objects being materialized, then apply the ordered typed config transactions; `/var` and `/srv` remain live mutable-root state
6. **Publish**: Advance one persisted replay phase at a time: artifact ready, current link durable, configuration status projected, matching system state active, and generation-bound database backup durable. Only the final phase makes publication debt terminal
7. **Recover**: Under the runtime mutation lock, resume at the persisted phase and replay each remaining idempotent effect. A matching `/conary/current` link proves only link publication; it never implies configuration projection or database backup completion
8. **Compensate**: Rollback binds its publication debt to the exact pre-mutation snapshot and records a new compensating changeset
9. **GC**: Remove old generations and CAS objects only after resolving every recoverable publication and effective rollback snapshot

Raw, qcow2, and ISO export copy both typed manifests and their manifest-listed
CAS objects. Export reconstructs `/var` and `/srv` in the carrier root and
projects `/etc` into `/conary/etc-state/<generation>` above one explicit empty
lower directory. Read-only carriers copy that seeded config upper to runtime
tmpfs before mounting it, so writability never replaces or bypasses the
artifact's typed state authority. Carrier projection restores the verified
generation-root metadata on `/` and the exact manifest metadata on `/usr`,
`/etc`, `/boot`, and each root symlink; the disk backend excludes only `/boot/`
contents so it does not replace the signed mountpoint with a default directory.
Boot entries disable source-`fstab` generation because a self-contained carrier
owns a new partition topology. Writable carriers declare their `CONARY_ESP`
mount through the boot contract, while the original `/etc/fstab` bytes remain
part of the unchanged mutable-state seed.

Generation build also seals a versioned carrier-capability projection from the
persisted target inventory into artifact manifest v3. Host-inventory document
version 4 captures the target `/usr` node's exact opaque `security.selinux`
value when that xattr is present; absence or an unsupported xattr facility is
an explicit `None`, while any other probe failure aborts initialization.
Export applies a sealed value only to regular files and directories in the
copied carrier CAS subtree. Composefs logical nodes retain their own exact
manifest xattrs; this separate target-supplied value authorizes the external
immutable objects that back their bytes. Conary does not parse the context or
select it from a distro, path, policy name, or built-in label table.
Host-inventory document version 3 must be replaced by rerunning
`conary system init`, and artifact manifest v2 generations must be rebuilt
before export. For a bootstrap target that is not running yet, the exact
captured `/usr` manifest node supplies the same target fact; bootstrap artifact
writers may not substitute the build host's context or an empty default.

### Generation Module (`crates/conary-core/src/generation/`)

The primary builder for composefs generations. Uses the composefs-rs crate
(v0.3.0) to serialize validated exact `GenerationRootManifest` input to EROFS.
Explicit generation builds project installed state into the same typed root
contract. Package mutation publication accepts only its persisted cumulative
selected-root snapshot; there is no reconstruction fallback.
Submodules: builder.rs (public
generation-builder hub),
builder/create.rs and builder/rebuild.rs (generation creation and recovery
rebuild orchestration), builder/carrier_capabilities.rs (persisted target
capability projection), builder/boot_root.rs (the typed `BootRoot` policy:
`Host` generates the initramfs from the generation sysroot and may reuse boot
assets across generations; `Staged` reads runtime boot files from an explicit
directory; when that directory lacks the release initramfs it generates one
there with dracut (running depmod first if `modules.dep` is also missing), so
the staged directory must be writable),
builder/boot_assets.rs, builder/boot_reuse.rs,
builder/initramfs.rs,
builder/kernel.rs, and builder/sysroot.rs (runtime boot asset and sysroot
materialization support), builder/root_validation.rs and
builder/runtime_inputs.rs (self-contained runtime input validation), and
root_manifest/composefs.rs (exact typed-root EROFS serialization). artifact.rs
owns the exportable generation contract and boot assets;
artifact/cas.rs owns the CAS manifest and verification modes. Runtime builders
perform one exact path-and-size preflight and pass its canonical-root and exact-
object-set proof through artifact writing; the persisted artifact is still
independently reopened before publication. Meanwhile,
artifact/boot_reuse.rs reopens only a completed generation's boot contract and
stages its verified immutable files without enumerating the payload CAS;
the local verified-CAS artifact loader reopens every artifact and manifest
digest plus all referenced CAS paths and sizes without rereading immutable
payload bodies; the explicit artifact/export loader remains the deep
content-verification boundary;
export.rs owns
raw/qcow2 disk export from validated artifacts; mount.rs owns composefs
mount/unmount; metadata.rs owns JSON
metadata), gc.rs (typed CAS reachability and object collection), delta.rs
(EROFS image deltas), and
composefs.rs (runtime feature detection). Exact config policy and persisted
snapshot types live in `crates/conary-core/src/config_transaction.rs`;
`apps/conary/src/commands/generation/config_transaction.rs` captures live
identities and atomically materializes generation-local `/etc` uppers. There is
no generic hash-conflict/manual-merge path. Target immutable-backing security
discovery and application live in
`crates/conary-core/src/ccs/hooks/capabilities/filesystem_security.rs`.

An ordinary package publication reuses the current completed generation's
kernel, initramfs, and EFI files only when its terminal publication row proves
the prior applied-changeset high-water mark and no applied typed boot-runtime
request exists in the interval through the current high-water mark. Reuse
reopens the artifact and boot manifests, verifies all three source files, and
hard-links them into the pending generation before the new artifact contract
verifies them again. Any new boot-runtime request, missing terminal publication
authority, identity mismatch, or checksum failure takes the exact rebuild path
or fails closed. Package names, distribution labels, and path heuristics never
select this fast path.

### composefs Integration

The composefs driver (Linux 6.2+, `CONFIG_EROFS_FS`) provides:
- Content-verified overlays using fs-verity
- Efficient sharing of identical files across generations via CAS
- Atomic generation switching without unmounting

## Bootstrap Pipeline

Build a complete Conary-managed system from scratch. The pipeline has
6 phases whose package selection and ordering are guided by LFS 13.0-systemd,
with documented recipe-level deviations where Conary intentionally differs:

```
Phase 1: CrossTools (LFS Ch5)
  Cross-toolchain for target arch
  Produces: $LFS/tools/
       |
Phase 2: TempTools (LFS Ch6-7)
  Temporary tools (17 cross-compiled + 6 chroot packages)
       |
Phase 3: FinalSystem (LFS Ch8)
  Complete Linux system (80 packages; Chapter 8 set with
  systemd-boot-over-GRUB deviation)
  Built inside chroot
       |
Phase 4: SystemConfig (LFS Ch9)
  Network, fstab, kernel, bootloader configuration
       |
Phase 5: BootableImage (LFS Ch10)
  systemd-repart for bootstrap sysroot disk images
  Output formats: raw/qcow2 disk images, bootstrap preview ISO scaffolding,
  or EROFS generation artifact
       |
Phase 6: Tier2 (BLFS + Conary)
  PAM, OpenSSH, curl, Rust, Conary self-hosting
```

Do not treat this section as the authoritative version inventory. Use
`recipes/versions.toml`, individual recipe headers, and the active bootstrap
specs/plans when exact package versions or intentional divergences matter.
Tier 2 recipes and self-host-specific staged inputs enforce SHA-256 checksums;
earlier bootstrap phases still carry MD5-only recipe entries in the current
tree. Recipe execution uses the bootstrap container configuration where the
phase supports it; the self-hosting VM wrapper deliberately runs chroot-owning
phases through a rootful handoff so the Rust bootstrap code owns `/dev`,
`/proc`, `/sys`, `/run`, and `chroot` setup.

Bootstrap trust has a TOFU boundary: the first trusted TUF root metadata and
bootstrap source manifests must arrive through an authenticated out-of-band
channel or another operator-controlled path. Bootstrap source identities are
mandatory; placeholder checksums and verification-bypass modes are rejected.

Supports x86_64, aarch64, and riscv64 targets. Dry-run mode
(`--dry-run`) validates the full pipeline without building.

## Database Schema

Persisted lifecycle vocabularies belong to their model enums. Operational SQL
binds those owners' encodings, and stored-value readers retain
`InvalidPersistedValue` when obsolete data cannot authorize work. Backup
publication and changeset verification lives in `db/backup/publication.rs`.
Sync refresh states and the terminal-state SQL set belong to
`repository/sync/remi/run/contract.rs::ProfileSyncRunState`.
`derivation/index.rs::DerivationTrustLevel` owns the existing integer mapping;
the executor stores provenance before recording local-build trust in the same
index row. Serialization, CAS, and index failures propagate. The pipeline does
not write trust a second time. These ownership changes preserve current stored
strings and integers and require no schema revision or rebuild of valid data.

Operational runtime state lives in SQLite. The pre-alpha database contract has
one current schema epoch initialized by `crates/conary-core/src/db/schema.rs`.
The operational schema is split by ownership under
`crates/conary-core/src/db/current_schema/sql/`: local package-manager state,
repository/service state, and Remi conversion/administration state.

Schema revision 57 is a rebuild-only hard cut. Installed CCS remove hooks and
their rollback snapshots persist the hook's typed interpreter; revision 56
rows carry none and are rebuilt rather than defaulted. Repository
`security_advisory_support = supported` means explicit operator
authorization to classify feed advisories as security updates; feed-authored
`trust` and `source_trust` strings remain diagnostic only. Revision 55
repository values predate that authority meaning and are rejected as typed
rebuild state rather than inherited. Remi's operational database
stores immutable-catalog resource metadata, ordered profile members, fenced
active pointers, refresh runs, runtime sessions, and exact work/reader/
conversion pins. Activated native package, provide, and requirement authority
lives in verified standalone SQLite catalogs beneath the configured storage
root, never in operational package rows. Repository conversion identity
requires the complete input profile-revision SHA-256; its row and durable pin
are created and deleted atomically. The previous latest-profile key and
source-profile-only retention decision have no compatibility reader. Native
authenticated roots are validated as transient refresh inputs and recorded in
immutable source manifests; repositories no longer retain a mutable latest-root
observation. A resource is identified by that exact manifest SHA-256. Distinct
authenticated manifests may bind one byte-identical normalized catalog
artifact, while membership, reachability, deletion, and filesystem ownership
remain scoped to each resource identity and exact bundle. Every registered
resource also carries one closed, filesystem-independent physical attestation
bound beside that exact manifest and catalog artifact identity: the exact
SHA-256 and size of a canonical fixed-chunk digest manifest plus the v1 chunk
size and artifact-derived count. Registered catalog reads authenticate their
covering chunks before SQLite receives bytes, while publication retains the
complete structural and logical proof. Missing, malformed, mis-sized, stale,
or artifact-mismatched attestations are rejected. There is no
filesystem-selected proof kind and no durable complete-scan fallback.
Repository freshness is four explicit facts: `last_checked_at` records a
successful authenticated check, `last_changed_at` a different source revision,
`last_validated_at` completed parser/catalog validation, and
`last_published_at` activation of that changed revision. A successful no-op
advances checked and validated only; failed private work advances none.

Databases from retired schema revisions are rejected with an exact recovery
command. `conary system rebuild-db --discard-state --yes` consolidates the
retired SQLite state into a durable snapshot under the Conary backup directory,
then creates the one current schema and current repository/host-capability
authority. It does not infer installed state from generation artifacts: the
operator must resync repository metadata and explicitly re-adopt native packages
that Conary should track. `conary system init` remains non-destructive and does
not carry a compatibility chain or silently reset an existing database.

The stable table families are:

- Installed state: troves, changesets, lifecycle events, files, components, dependencies, and provides
- Repository and resolution state: enrollment, local/client-synced package metadata, capability inputs, labels, and canonical mapping data
- System state and configuration: state snapshots, config tracking, triggers, redirects, and settings
- Try state: active/kept/rolled-back package try sessions and selected generation metadata
- Security and provenance: TUF metadata, provenance records, admin tokens, and audit data
- Service and federation state: immutable-catalog pointers/resources/pins, conversion/cache/download analytics, federation peers, and test-run persistence

When exact table names or counts matter, inspect `crates/conary-core/src/db/models/`
and the current ownership SQL instead of relying on this overview.

## Package Graph

The root manifest owns the virtual workspace and shared package metadata. Build
the owning package directly:

| Package | Purpose | Typical command |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| `conary` | Package-manager CLI | `cargo build -p conary` |
| `remi` | Remi conversion/proxy service | `cargo build -p remi` |
| `conaryd` | Local daemon: query routes plus install/remove/update/enhance jobs | `cargo build -p conaryd` |
| `conary-test` | Test harness | `cargo build -p conary-test` |
| `conary-bootstrap` | Shared binary bootstrap helpers | `cargo build -p conary-bootstrap` |
| `conary-core` | Shared library | `cargo build -p conary-core` |
| `conary-agent-contract` | Transport-neutral agent operation contract | `cargo build -p conary-agent-contract` |
| `conary-mcp` | Shared MCP helpers | `cargo build -p conary-mcp` |

## Key Design Decisions

**Typed SQLite authorities with immutable Remi catalogs**: Operational state
lives in the current SQLite schema; no loose TOML/YAML/JSON state file becomes
runtime authority. Remi package catalogs are the deliberate exception to the
single-file layout: versioned manifests bind content-addressed standalone
SQLite artifacts, while the operational database owns only their durable
resource facts, fenced active pointer, and exact reachability pins.
Conary writes SQLite-native checkpoint backups around first-wave
adoption/unadoption mutations and writes generation-bound v3 recovery authority
under `/conary/generations/<n>/state/`. A new base does not compact the database
with `VACUUM INTO`: it selects reflink first, SQLite online backup as the
portable fallback, and a full copy only when both faster providers are
unavailable. Normal generation publication instead records a SQLite session
changeset from before the package transaction through terminal publication.

Schema revision 57 retains the immutable Remi source/profile resource graph and
exact input-revision conversion pins, removes the false one-artifact-to-one-
manifest constraint, binds each exact catalog to its host-local physical
attestation, and keeps check/change/validation/publication facts separate.
Native parser schema 1 streams authenticated file-backed
children into private catalog candidates; exact normalized cache reuse binds
the source stream, root, child roles and digests, parser version, and catalog
schema. Private candidates are reopened and verified, synchronized, and
atomically renamed into content-addressed storage before a fenced operational
transaction may activate them. Logical hashing, verified-cache replay, and
profile composition stream normalized relation rows, so one source package
cannot turn its relation cardinality into repository-sized publication memory.
Sparse, readiness, conversion, prewarm, detail, search, index, OCI, delta, and
package-serving readers open the exact immutable revision and never fall back
to operational package rows. Earlier pre-alpha databases must be rebuilt.

Schema revision 42 retained revision 41's boot-runtime mutation authority and
adds durable repository synchronization runs, per-repository fencing epochs,
and exact-profile sparse projection revisions. A current run records its
process owner, candidate, input/output revision, heartbeat, lease, typed state,
and typed failure; publication transactionally proves the current fence before
replacing active rows. Earlier pre-alpha databases must be rebuilt.
Revision 41 added captured boot-runtime mutation work to the generation
activation request union. Exact mutation argv plus the selected root's invoked
and canonical provider paths and executable SHA-256 commit with the owning
changeset and remain retryable until one eligible generation applies them.
Revision 40 replaced repository publication chunk-list JSON with the signed CCS
transport envelope. That envelope owns the exact ordered object identities and
sizes used by publication, acquisition, federation, reference accounting, and
GC.
Revision 39 added one generation-delta mutation epoch row plus generated
triggers for every authoritative table. A connection-local SQLite function
assigns one UUID to all writes in a transaction, and the triggers persist that
UUID exactly once for the transaction. Generation publication can therefore
admit a session changeset only when the live database still names the exact
prior generation baseline; `PRAGMA data_version` separately rejects a commit
from another connection while capture is active. Every Conary write connection
registers the function before schema validation. An unconfigured writer fails
closed at the trigger instead of changing authority without advancing the
epoch. This is a pre-alpha hard cut: revision 40 databases must be rebuilt.

`generation_backup_chain.rs` owns the active v3 format: one
content-addressed SQLite base plus at most 32 ordered, content-addressed session
changesets. Each generation hard-links the complete base/delta set into its own
state directory, so generation GC never leaves a surviving manifest dependent
on an ancestor directory. The recursive chain identity binds the base digest,
base token, every ordered delta digest, and every source/result token transition.
Normal append writes and hashes only the new changeset; full payload hashing,
changeset replay, SQLite integrity checking, and foreign-key checking occur
when verification or recovery materializes the database. A schema change,
32-delta chain limit, mismatched source baseline, concurrent-connection write,
retry publication, or otherwise unprovable capture requires a new full base.

Publication first persists a crash-valid `active_marked` chain, advances the
SQLite publication row to terminal state, then atomically replaces the manifest
with the recorder's cumulative terminal delta. A crash before replacement keeps
the provisional chain recoverable; its token mismatch forces the next normal
publication to create a new base. A successful terminal replacement removes
unreferenced provisional artifacts. The retired v2 whole-file manifest and
checksum sidecar have no compatibility reader.

**Composefs-native transactions**: Every package mutation follows one linear
pipeline: resolve -> fetch -> materialize an isolated selected root -> run typed
lifecycle, payload, config, and trigger work inside that root and one SQLite
transaction -> append and bind the exact selected-root snapshot -> commit
SQLite -> publish the recorded generation. The selected root starts from the
latest retryable snapshot, the current generation artifact, or authoritative DB/CAS
state when no generation exists. There is no mutable-host package execution
path.

Package persistence within that SQLite transaction uses transaction-local TEMP
tables owned by `PackageTransactionStaging`. Cached load statements accept
typed payload nodes/content, component membership, replacement-owner decisions,
config projections, and history rows. Validation loads canonical claims as
sets, derives deterministic anchor decisions, and then projects content,
anchors, claims, hardlinks, components, configs, and history through a fixed
family of ordered SQL statements. Install/update, adoption, remove, and
rollback history share this authority; dropping or rolling back the transaction
removes all staging state, so it cannot become a second persisted database.

Before the SQLite commit, any lifecycle, payload, config, trigger, or validation
failure rolls back the database transaction and discards the selected root.
After commit, a publication failure leaves typed debt plus the exact snapshot
for deterministic retry. `LiveRootTransaction` remains an internal journal for
the disposable selected-root session; it is not authority to mutate the host
root. DB backups remain recovery artifacts, not a second mutable source of
truth. If `/conary/current` names a missing or invalid artifact, recovery
rebuilds from DB/CAS state while explicit boot-selection recovery owns scanning,
promotion, and remounting.
Generation-aware CCS installs follow the same model for file capabilities by
writing the typed Linux revision-2 xattr through an `O_NOFOLLOW` descriptor in
the selected root without an external `setcap` dependency, persisting
file-capability authority in SQLite, attaching
`security.capability` during runtime-input collection, requiring immediate
publication instead of `--defer-generation`, and surfacing the resulting
capability-xattr count through generation inspection metadata.

SQLite-native backups recover Conary manager visibility for packages and
generations represented by the backed-up DB. They do not recover missing
package payloads, private keys, remote repository history, or native
package-manager transaction history.

**Content-addressable storage**: Files are stored by SHA-256 hash in a flat
CAS directory. This enables deduplication across packages, integrity
verification, and rollback-oriented recovery when the required content and
state references have been preserved.

**Chunk-level distribution**: Packages are split into variable-size chunks
via FastCDC. Clients only download chunks they don't already have, giving
implicit delta compression without pre-computing version-to-version diffs.

**Signed remote system models**: Remote model collections have one exact wire
contract. `conary model publish` requires an Ed25519 signing key and an
authenticated Remi admin request (`REMI_ADMIN_TOKEN` or
`CONARY_REMI_ADMIN_TOKEN`). Remi verifies the signature and canonical content
hash before atomically replacing persisted collection state, then serves the
same signed data and signer identity. Every online or cached remote include is
reverified against the model's explicit `[include].trusted_keys`; unsigned
collections, missing trust roots, signer-ID mismatches, and stale cache
metadata fail closed.

**Source package authority pipeline**: RPM, Debian, and Arch parsers retain
exact identity and declared provisions in format-specific authority records.
The closed `SourcePackageAuthority` dispatch exposes named, fallible
projections for dependency resolution and CCS v3 signing; exact identity is
never recovered from or inserted into the declared-capability list. Source
configuration declarations likewise remain format-specific and carry an
explicit matched/absent payload association. Signed CCS, installed config
state, and generation transactions preserve that distinction without
synthesizing content. The retired common package/config adapters are gone. The
W5 contract in
[`docs/specs/source-package-authority.md`](specs/source-package-authority.md)
owns the lossless format-specific authority and consumer boundaries.
Conversion remains transparent to the caller, but normalization is owned by
the named consumer rather than initial parsing.

**Namespace isolation**: Scriptlets run in Linux containers (mount, PID, IPC,
UTS namespaces) with resource limits. Capability enforcement uses mandatory
Landlock rules for exact absolute path roots and seccomp-BPF for exact
target-ABI syscall names. Filesystem wildcards, syscall wildcards, named
syscall profiles, cross-ABI aliases, and Linux process-capability inference are
not authority; packages declare exact `capabilities.linux.required` values.

- **Repository trust**: TUF (The Update Framework) with threshold signatures,
  key rotation, and expiry enforcement
- **Package integrity**: CCS packages carry CBOR manifests with Merkle trees
  and Ed25519 signatures
- **Runtime isolation**: Scriptlets execute in namespaced containers with
  resource limits and filesystem/syscall restrictions
- **Provenance**: Full DNA tracking from source URL through build environment
  to deployed content, with optional SLSA attestations
