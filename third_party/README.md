# Third-Party Divergence Inventory

This file is the single inventory for Cargo dependencies whose source differs
from their published upstream. The TOML block is both the human audit record
and the input to `scripts/check-third-party-divergence.py`; do not maintain a
second list.

The structural check runs in documentation truth plus every pull-request and
post-merge dependency-consistency job. The upstream exit check runs in the
scheduled security audit every six hours. When an upstream exit condition is
met, that audit fails and the owning dependency must be tested and either
returned to upstream authority or deliberately re-pinned with this record
updated.

The vendored crates retain their upstream license metadata and notices. The
resolvo patch has additional implementation context in
[`resolvo-0.12.0-patched/CONARY_PATCH.md`](resolvo-0.12.0-patched/CONARY_PATCH.md).
