// crates/conary-core/src/container/child_fork_safety.rs

//! The post-fork child path may not log or spawn.
//!
//! `fork()` gives the child the parent's lock state with none of its other
//! threads. glibc re-initializes its own primitives in the child, so allocation
//! survives; Rust-level locks do not. `tracing`'s dispatcher is a global
//! `RwLock`, so a child that logs while another thread held that lock at fork
//! time never returns, and the parent reports `Script timed out after ...`.
//!
//! That is not a hypothetical shape. `setup_mount_namespace` logged through
//! `debug!` every time a bind-mount source was absent, which is most sandbox
//! starts, and the CLI forks from a `#[tokio::main]` runtime with worker
//! threads logging alongside it.
//!
//! Reviewing for this is unreliable, because the offending call looks like
//! ordinary logging. So it is checked instead: the child-path sources are
//! compiled into the test binary and scanned.
//!
//! The remaining third-party calls were audited at their exact Cargo.lock
//! checksums: landlock 0.4.5's production path is direct ruleset/file/syscall
//! machinery with no lazy global, and seccompiler 0.5.0's post-fork operation
//! is only `apply_filter` (prctl + seccomp). A dependency change deliberately
//! fails the checksum test below and requires a new source audit.

/// Sources that run between `fork()` and `exec()`.
