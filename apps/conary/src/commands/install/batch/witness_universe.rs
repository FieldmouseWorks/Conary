//! Which installed identities may witness this transaction's own reasoning.
//!
//! Ordering and promise planning certify dependency edges against a set of
//! package identities. That set is the transaction's *end state*, not the
//! database as it stands when planning runs: an identity this transaction
//! itself deletes cannot carry an edge the transaction is about to rely on.
//!
//! Two installed identities leave during a batch, and both used to remain
//! admissible witnesses:
//!
//! * the pre-upgrade identity of a package the batch upgrades, whose
//!   capabilities -- ordinary provides and promised paths alike -- the incoming
//!   version is free to drop; and
//! * an installed package an incoming negative relation removes, which is
//!   selected by the same relation authority that plans the removal.
//!
//! Both are named by exact trove identity, never by package name: a name can be
//! shared by parallel-installed identities, and only the trove this transaction
//! deletes is leaving. The surviving set plus the incoming identities is what
//! the transaction actually provides when it commits.
