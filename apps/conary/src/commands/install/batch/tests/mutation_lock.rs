#![cfg(test)]

//! Certification reads installed state with the mutation lock already held.
//!
//! A batch is admitted on facts it reads from installed state: which
//! requirements the end-state universe satisfies, which promises it relies on,
//! which installed packages the incoming relations remove. Reading those facts
//! before waiting for the runtime mutation lock leaves a window -- another
//! transaction can delete a provider the certification leaned on, and this
//! batch still commits against a universe that no longer exists. The lock is
//! what closes that window, so the facts have to be read on its far side.

use super::*;

/// Delete the only provider while the batch waits for the mutation lock.
///
/// The deletion lands after the batch has started and before it holds the
/// lock, which is exactly the interval a pre-lock snapshot would have read
/// across. Certification must see the deletion, because the database it is
/// about to commit into is the one without the provider.
