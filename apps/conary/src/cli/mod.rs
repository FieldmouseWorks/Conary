// apps/conary/src/cli/mod.rs
//! CLI definitions for the Conary package manager
//!
//! This module contains all command-line interface definitions using clap.
//! The actual command implementations are in the `commands` module.
//!
//! Primary commands are hoisted to root level for convenience:
//! - `install` - Install package(s) or collection (@name)
//! - `remove` - Remove a package
//! - `update` - Update package(s) or collection (@name)
//! - `search` - Search for packages
//! - `list` - List installed packages
//! - `autoremove` - Remove orphaned packages
//! - `pin` / `unpin` - Pin/unpin packages from updates
//!
//! Management contexts:
//! - `system` - System administration (state, triggers, redirects, gc, etc.)
//! - `repo` - Repository management
//! - `config` - Configuration file management
//!
//! Advanced/Developer:
//! - `query` - Dependency analysis and advanced queries
//! - `ccs` - Native CCS package format
//! - `derive` - Derived package management
//! - `model` - System model commands
//! - `collection` - Collection management (create, delete, etc.)
